p. 9, Theorem 0.3: We should have added the hypothesis that $X\cap Y$
is generically smooth. 

As stated, this version of B\'ezout's theorem can fail when the intersection
scheme $X\cap Y$ is not generically smooth. For example If X is the union of two 2-planes meeting in 
a point in $\PP^{4}$ and $Y$ is a generic 2-plane passing through this point, then
the degree of $X\cap Y$ is 3, not 2 as asserted. (This example can be massaged to
make $X$ into a variety).

However the generically smooth case implies the correct result
$\deg( [X][Y]) = \deg (X) \deg(Y)$, where $[X][Y]$ is the product in the Chow ring.

p. 17 line -11: "it is a" should be "it corresponds to a"

p. 25, line 16: "the map $C \to \phi(C)$ is finite". Correct, but we should have mentioned "quasifinite \& projective implies finite" in the prerequisites section.

p. 30, line 4:  $\div$ prints as the sign for dividing one number by another. Should print as $\rm Div$ . 

p. 31, line -3 : after the summation sign, $dx_1$ should be $dx_0$

p. 36, line -3: $(\sO_{\PP^1}, W)$  -> $(\sO_{\PP^1}(d), W)$

p. 49: line -4, formula for $p_a$: $K_X$ should be $K_S$

p. 50, Theorem 2.8: Delete the $+1$ at the end of the formula.

p. 53, This is not correct. The correct version is given in exercise 2.14. Delete exercise 2.2 (2). 

p. 61, line -1,-2: delete the (incorrect) phrase beginning ", so $\Gamma$ imposes... ."

p. 65, line -9: $H^0_*(I_C/Q)$ should be $H^0_*(\sI_C/Q)$

p. 65, line -5 : $I_C/Q$ should be $\sI_C/Q$

p.72: ``sum of $\Sym^{e_i}V$'' . It would be better to say "a sum of representations $\Sym^dV$
for various $d$ (the symbols $e_i$ were used for the basis of $V$).

p. 78, line 17: "normal sheaf" -> "conormal sheaf"

p. 78, line -10: "is a globally on $C$" -> "is a global section of $\omega_C$."

p. 82, part (2) of the proof of Corollary 4.8. Replace this paragraph (which is nonsense) by:

(2) In this case a divisor $\Gamma$ in the series $\mathcal V$ fails by 2 to impose independent conditions
on forms of degree $d-3$. It follows that if we subtract a point from $\Gamma$ the resulting divisor $\Gamma'$ fails
by at least one to impose independent conditions on forms of degree $d-3$. Thus $\Gamma$ has degree
at least $d$, and by part (1), $\Gamma'$ is contained in a line. Repeating this argument with another point of $\Gamma$,
we see that $\Gamma$ must be the intersection of $C$ with a line; that is, $\mathcal V$ is the series $|\sO_C(1)|$.

p. 83, paragraph beginning on line -7. This is nonsense. Here is a characteristic 0 argument:
We may assume n>1. If the map p-> np were not surjective, it would be constant; equivalently, np~nq for every
pair of points p,q. But then every point would be a ramification point of the map
corresponding to the complete series |np|, so this map would be inseparable.

p. 90: The result of Exercise 4.1 is the same as Corollary 4.8.


p. 90: Exercise 4.3. the $x_0^2$ is multiplying the wrong side of the equation.

p. 91: The statement of the Sylvester Gallai theorem should be:
In any finite set $\Gamma\subset \PP^2_\RR$ not contained in a line
there is a line containing just 2 points of $\Gamma$.

p. 97, last sentence of 2nd para of 5.6: "$\Pic_d(C)$ is a for $\Pic_0(C)$ should say
``$\Pic_d(C)$ is a torsor for $\Pic_0(C)$, which means that if $\sL_0$ is an invertible sheaf of
degree $d$ on $C$, then the map $\Pic_0(C)\to \Pic_d(C)$ sending $\sL to \sL\otimes \sL_0$
is an isomorphism.''

p. 104, line -15: end of line, should be $\geq 4$. Better argument for this para: If $D$ is a special divisor ,
then $|D|$ is a subseries of the canonical series, which itself is not very ample.

Theorem 10.1: $n$ should be $r$.

p. 106, third line before subsection 5.8: Should be $\omega_C \otimes \mathcal L'^{-1}$, where $\mathcal L'$ has degree 1

p. 107: Lemma 5.17: change $\PP^r$ to $\PP^n$ to avoid the conflict of notation between that $r$ and
the superscript on $\Sigma^r_d$. 

p. 107, next to last sentence before the Proof of Martens Theorem: Should say: we see that
$\Sigma^{r-1}_d \setminus \Sigma^{r-1}_d$ is dense in $\Sigma^{r-1}_d$.


p. 107 line -7 Marten's should be Martens'

p. 108 Exc 5.2: This is the wrong defn of ``freely''. Should be: $gx = x$ only when $g$
is the identity.

p. 108 Exc 5.3.2 : $A^2$ should be $\mathbb A.^2$.

p. 114. This whole discussion assumes that the "topological covering space" is a finite covering.

p. 142, line 4: $m$ should be $m_{0}$.

p. 143, Example 7.14: the wording is confusing. Better: 
In the Grassmannian of lines $\GG(1,3)$, the Pl\"ucker coordinates of the line L that is the span of the points $q,r$ 
are the $2\times 2$ minors of the matrix...``

p. 149, line 2: "locally" should be "locally analyitically" (or \'etale locally?) on B in order to find these sections. So in the end, you are using descent to "glue" together the morphism. 

150: Second para of the proof: It might be necessary to make a base change before there are sections sections of your family of genus 1 curvesThis is OK  since to construct an isomorphism of the pullbacks of the families after finite base change.

p. 153 In constructing $Hilb^\circ$,  the curves should be smooth, irreducible and non-degenerate.


p. 187: The proof given for the case of equality in Castelnuovo's theorem is not correct: the top line of the first displayed diagram is NOT left exact.

To fix it, redraw the diagram, eliminating the top row, and replacing $m$ by $k$.

Let $a_{k}$ denote the right-hand map in the  middle row of the 
diagram, and let $b_{k}$ denote the right hand map in the bottom row of the diagram. Equality in Castelnuovo's theorem implies that for all $k$ the
rank of $a_{k}$, which is the number of conditions imposed
on $V_{k}$ by $\Gamma$, is equal to the rank of $b$, 
which is the number of conditions imposed
on $H^{0}(\sO_{C}(k))$ by $\Gamma$

Since the bottom row of the diagram is left exact, the rank of $b$
is $h^{0}(\sO_{C}(k)) - h^{0}(\sO_{C}(k-1))$. Since $V_{k-1}$
is contained in the kernel of $a$, the 
rank of $a$ is $\leq \dim V_{k} -\dim V_{k-1}$, whence
$$
\dim V_{k} -\dim V_{k-1} \geq  h^{0}(\sO_{C}(k)) - h^{0}(\sO_{C}(k-1))
$$
for every $k$. The rest of the proof can be taken starting with
``For large $m$ the restriction map...''

p. 201: last para before 11.3. can intersect... should be cannot intersect....

p. 202: We are rather cavalier about the fiber product, and this can be confusing.

p. 203, statement of Thm 11. delete first half of 2nd line (it's a broken, repeated phrase).

p. 212: Cor 12.5. Hypothesis should be $r\geq 1$.

p. 213: $C_{d-1} = \binom{2d-2}{d-1}/d$ is the correct number.

page 224, between the first two displayed equations: "and the on $C$ to be" presumably should be "and the \emph{ramification divisor} on $C$ to be"

page 242, line 7: "an" should be "on"

page 242, last displayed equation: $d+1$ should be $d$
