\chapter{Curves of genus 0 and 1}\label{genus 0 and 1 chapter}

In this chapter, we'll begin our project of describing curves in projective space with the simplest cases, that of curves of genus 0 and 1. Despite the relative simplicity of these curves, there are many interesting statements to make about the geometry of their embeddings in $\PP^r$, as well as many conjectures and open problems.

On a curve of genus 0, there is a unique invertible sheaf of given degree $d$; and on a curve of genus 1 all invertible sheaves of given degree $d$ are congruent modulo the automorphism group of the curve. Thus, all invertible sheaves of given degree $d$ behave in the same way. This is no longer true for curves of higher genus!
%Our knowledge of the geometry of curves becomes increasingly less complete as the genus increases, and 6, as we shall see, is a natural turning point; we will consider the case of curves of genus $, 5$ and $6$ in Chapter~\ref{genus 4, 5 and 6 chapter}

\section{Curves of genus 0} 

As we saw in more generality in Example~\ref{linear systems on Pr}, there is for each $d \in \ZZ$  a unique invertible sheaf $\cO_{\PP1} (d)$
of degree $d$ on $\PP^1$, and $H^0(\cO_{\PP1} (d)) = \CC^{d+1}$.

By \TRR, any invertible sheaf of degree $d$ on a curve of genus 0, like $\PP^1$, has at least $d+1$ sections. In fact (over $\CC$, or any algebraically
closed field), this characterizes $\PP^1$:

\begin{theorem}\label{characterization of P1}
Let $C$ be a reduced, irreducible projective curve and let $\cL$ be an invertible sheaf of degree $d$ on $C$. If $\h^0(\cL) \geq d+1$ then
$C \cong \PP^1$, so $\cL \cong \cO_{\PP^1}(d)$, and $\h^0(\cL) = d+1$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $p_1,\dots p_{d-1}$ be general points of $C$, and set $\cL':=\cL(-p_1-\cdots-p_{d-1})$. From the correspondence between divisors and
invertible sheaves, we see that the degree of $\cL'$ is $1$.
 Since $\cL$ is locally isomorphic to the sheaf of functions on $C$, the condition of vanishing at a point imposes at most 1 linear condition on 
the global sections of $\cL$, and thus $H^0(\cL') \geq 2$, so we may assume from the outset that $d =1$.

The linear system $(\cL, H^0(\cL))$ cannot have any base points, since
otherwise after subtracting one, we would get an invertible sheaf of degree $\leq 0$ with two independent global sections. Again by the correspondence
with divisors, neither of these sections could vanish at any point of $C$, so their ratio would be a non-constant function defined everywhere on $C$,
a contradiction.

Thus we see that the linear system $(\cL, H^0(\cL))$ defines a morphism $\phi: C\to \PP^1$ of degree 1 whose fibers are the divisors defined by
the vanishing of sections of $\cL$, and which are thus of degree 1. Thus if $p\in C$ is the preimage of $q\in \PP^1$, the induced map of local rings
$\phi^*:\cO_{\PP^1, q} \to \cO_{C, p}$ is a finite, birational map. Since $\cO_{\PP^1, q}$ is integrally closed, this is an isomorphism. Thus 
$\phi$ is an isomorphism, as required. 
 \end{proof}

Note that we used the algebraic closure of the ground field in choosing points on $C$.


\begin{corollary}
 Every smooth curve $C$ of genus 0 over an algebraically closed field is isomorphic to $\PP^1$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
 By \trr, any linear system $\cL$ of degree $d$ on $C$ has $h^0\cL \geq d+1$.
\end{proof}

Note that all the above depends fundamentally on the algebraic closure of the ground field: over a non-algebraically closed field, a curve $C$ of genus 0 need not have any points, or any line bundles of odd degree (since the canonical bundle $K_C$ has degree $-2$, there do necessarily exist line bundles of every even degree; thus an arbitrary curve of genus 0 is isomorphic to a conic plane curve). 
The classification of curves of genus 0 over non-algebraically closed fields is a subject that goes back to Gauss.

\section{Rational Normal Curves}\label{rational normal curves section}

Recall from Example~\ref{Veronese definition} that the image of the $d$-th \emph{Veronese map}  
$$
\phi_d: \PP^1 \to \PP(H^0((\cO_{\PP^1}(d)) \cong \PP^d \quad, (s,t) \mapsto (s^d, s^{d-1}t, \dots, t^d)
$$
corresponding to by the complete linear system $|\cO_{\PP^1}(d)|$ is called the \emph{rational normal curve} of degree $d$. Rational normal curves arise often in the literature because of their they have many extremal properties. 

\subsubsection{Rational normal curves have minimal degree}

\begin{proposition}
If $C$ is a reduced, irreducible nondegenerate curve in $\PP^d$ then $\deg C \geq d$, with equality if and only if $C$ is a  rational normal curve.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By the correspondence between morphisms and linear systems, the invertible sheaf $\cL$ corresponding to the morphism $C \hookrightarrow \PP^d$ has degree $d$ and
 $h^0(\cL) \geq d+1$. The conclusion follows from Theorem~\ref{characterization of P1}.
\end{proof}

We will see more generally that, if $X$ is a non-degenerate variety in $\PP^d$ of dimension $k$, then $\deg(X) \geq d-k+1$; and we will describe the varieties that achieve the minimum in Chapter~\ref{ScrollsChapter}.

\subsubsection{Points on a rational normal curve are maximally independent}

\begin{proposition}\label{independence on rnc}
If $C\subset \PP^d$ is a rational normal curve of degree $d$ and $\Gamma\subset C$ is a subscheme of length $\ell \leq d+1$, then
$\Gamma$ lies on no plane of dimension $<\ell$. In particular, any $m \leq d+1$ distinct points on a rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^d$ are linearly independent
and span $\PP^d$.
\end{proposition}

The rational normal curve is the unique smooth curve with this property, as we shall see in Chapter~\ref{InflectionsChapter}. 

\begin{proof}
 We can reduce to the case $\ell = d+1$ by adding points to $\Gamma$, so it suffices to do that case. Suppose that $C$ is the rational normal curve.
If $\Gamma$ is contained in a hyperplane then by B\'ezout's Theorem the degree of $C$ would be $\geq d+1$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

For a related result see Corollary~\ref{uninflected}.

In the case of distinct points it is easy to make a direct argument: In affine coordinates chosen so that none of the points are
at infinity we can identify the points $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_{d+1} \in C \cong \PP^1$ with complex numbers, and the statement (for $\ell = d+1$) is tantamount to the nonvanishing of the Vandermonde determinant
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & \lambda_1 & \lambda_1^2 & \dots & \lambda_1^d \\
1 & \lambda_2 & \lambda_2^2 & \dots & \lambda_2^d \\
\vdots & & & & \vdots \\
1 & \lambda_{d+1} & \lambda_{d+1}^2 & \dots & \lambda_{d+1}^d \\
\end{vmatrix}
= \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq d+1} (\lambda_j - \lambda_i)
$$

\subsubsection{The equations defining a rational normal curve}

Choosing a basis $s,t$ for the linear forms on $\PP^1$, we can write
$$
\phi_d : (s,t) \mapsto (s^d, s^{d-1}t,\dots t^d)
$$
from which we see that $C$ lies in the zero locus of the homogeneous quadratic polynomial $z_iz_j - z_kz_l$ for every $i+j=k+l$. As a convenient way to package these, we can realize these forms the $2\times 2$ minors of the matrix
$$
M \; = \; \begin{pmatrix}
x_0 & x_1 & \dots & x_{d-1} \\
x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_d
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Note that if we substitute $s^it^{(d-i)}$ for $x_i$ and identify $H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(i)$ with $\CC[s,t]_i$, this becomes the multiplication table
$$
H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(i)) \times H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(d-i-1)) \to H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(d));
$$
we shall see a general version of this in Chapter~\ref{ScrollsChapter}, where we shall also prove that 
the minors of this matrix generate the ideal of forms on $\PP^d$ vanishing on $C$ (Proposition~\ref{RNC generators}).
For now we prove two slightly weaker results:

First, $C$ is set-theoretically defined by the $2\times 2$ minors of $M$. Explicitly, suppose that $p = (x_0,\dots,x_d) \in \PP^d$ is any point, and all the polynomials $Q_{ijkl}$ above vanish at $p$. If $x_0 = 0$, then from the vanishing of 
$\det \begin{pmatrix}
x_0 & x_1  \\
x_1 & x_2 
\end{pmatrix}$ 
we see that $x_1 = 0$, and similarly we have $x_2 = \dots = x_{d-1}=0$; this the point $p = (0,\dots,0,1)$, which is a point on the rational normal curve. On the other hand, if $x_0 \neq 0$, set $\lambda = x_1/x_0$; we see in turn that $x_2/x_1 = \dots = x_d/x_{d-1} = \lambda$; thus $p = (1, \lambda, \dots,\lambda^d)$, again a point of the rational normal curve.

Second, the ${d\choose 2}$ distinct $2\times 2$ minors of $M$ are linearly independent. To see this, write $\overline M$
for the matrix obtained by reducing $M$
modulo $x_0$ and $x_d$. It suffices to show that the minors of $\overline M$ generate the ${d\choose 2}$ quadratic monomials in $(x_1, \dots, x_{d-1})^2$. We may see this by induction on $d$: the minors of the reduced matrix
that involve the first column are the monomials 
$x_1x_{d-1}, x_2x_{d-1}, \dots, x_{d-1}^2)$, and modulo $x_{d-1}$ we get a matrix of the same form as $\overline M$ with one fewer column, whose
minors thus generate $(x_1, \dots, x_{d-2})^2$.

Note that
the restriction map
$$
H^0(\cO_{\PP^d}(2)) \; \to \; H^0(\cO_{C}(2)) = H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(2d))
$$
 is surjective  because every monomial of degree $2d$ on $\PP^1$ is a product of two monomials of degree $d$. Comparing dimensions, we see that the dimension of the kernel---that is, the space of quadratic polynomials on $\PP^d$ vanishing on $C$---has dimension
$$
\binom{d+2}{2} - (2d+1) \; = \; \binom{d}{2}.
$$


In fact, this gives us another characterization of rational normal curves as extremal: rational normal curves lie on more quadric hypersurfaces than any other irreducible, nondegenerate curve in $\PP^d$.

\begin{proposition}\label{rnc on most quadrics}
If $C \subset \PP^d$ is any irreducible, nondegenerate curve, then
$$
h^0(\cI_{C/\PP^d}(2)) \leq  \binom{d}{2};
$$
and if equality holds then $C$ is a rational normal curve
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Consider the restriction of the quadrics containing $C$ to a general hyperplane $H \cong \PP^{d-1} \subset \PP^d$, and let $\Gamma = H \cap C$. We have an exact sequence:
$$
0 \to \cI_{C/\PP^d}(1) \to \cI_{C/\PP^d}(2) \to \cI_{\Gamma/\PP^{d-1}}(2) \to 0.
$$ 
Since $C$ is nondegenerate, $h^0(\cI_{C/\PP^d}(1)) = 0$, and since $\deg C \geq d$, the hyperplane section $\Gamma$ of $C$ must contain at least $d$ linearly independent points. Since linearly independent points impose independent conditions on quadrics, we have
$$
h^0(\cI_{\Gamma/\PP^{d-1}}(2)) \leq h^0(\cO_{\PP^{d-1}}(2)) - d,
$$
establishing the desired inequality.
\end{proof}


From the projective normality of the rational normal curve (Example~\ref{rnc is projectively normal}), we know the Hilbert function of a rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^d$, and hence the dimensions of the graded pieces of its homogeneous ideal: we have
$$
h^0(\cI_{C/\PP^d}(m)) =  \binom{d+m}{m} - (md+1)
$$

\begin{exercise}
Establish the analog of Proposition~\ref{rnc on most quadrics} for hypersurfaces of any degree $m$, that is to say no irreducible, nondegenerate curve in $\PP^r$ lies on more hypersurfaces of degree $m$ than the rational normal curve.
To do this, let $C\subset \PP^d$ be any irreducible nondegenerate curve, and use the exact sequences
$$
0 \to \cI_{C/\PP^d}(l-1) \to \cI_{C/\PP^d}(l) \to \cI_{\Gamma/\PP^{d-1}}(l) \to 0.
$$ 
with $2 \leq l \leq m$ to show that
$$
h^0(\cI_{C/\PP^d}(m)) \leq  \binom{d+m}{m} - (md+1)
$$
with equality only if $C$ is a rational normal curve.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Prove directly  the special case $r=3$: that the twisted cubic is the unique irreducible, nondegenerate space curve lying on three quadrics. (Hint: if $C \subset \PP^3$ is such a curve lying on three quadrics, what must be the intersection of two of the quadrics containing $C$?)
\end{exercise}

\subsubsection{Rational normal curves are projectively homogeneous}

Another important property of rational normal curves $C \subset \PP^d$ is that they are \emph{projectively homogeneous} in the sense that the subgroup $G$ of the automorphism group $PGL_{d+1}$ of automorphisms of $\PP^d$ that carries $C$ to itself acts transitively on $C$. More generally,

\begin{proposition}\label{Veronese is projectively homogeneous}
If $X\subset \PP^n$ is the image of $\PP^r$ by the Veronese map corresponding to $|\sO_{\PP^r}(d)|$, then $X$ is projectively homogeneous.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First, $\PP^r$ is a homogeneous variety in the sense that $\Aut \PP^r$ acts transitively. If $\sigma$ is an automorphism then,
 because $\cO_{\PP^r}(d)$ is the unique
invertible sheaf of degree $d$ on $\PP^r$,  we have $\sigma^*\cO_{\PP^r}(d) = \cO_{\PP^r}(d)$ so $\sigma$ induces an automorphism $\phi$ on $H^0(\cO_{\PP^r}(d))$, and an automorphism $\overline \phi$ on the ambient space $\PP H^0(\cO_{\PP^r}(d))$ of the target of the $d$-th Veronese map. If $\alpha$
is a rational function with divisor $D$, then $\phi(\alpha) = \alpha\circ \sigma$ has divisor $\sigma^{-1}(D)$, so $\overline\phi^{-1}$ induces $\sigma$ on $\PP^r$. 
\end{proof}

The rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^r$ can  be characterized among irreducible, nondegenerate curves as the unique projectively homogeneous curve in $\PP^r$ (Corollary~\ref{no more projectively homogeneous curves}.

\begin{exercise}
Let $\PP^1 \hookrightarrow C \subset \PP^3$ be a twisted cubic. Show that the normal bundle $\cN_{C/\PP^3}$ (defined to be the quotient of the restriction $T_{\PP^3}|_C$ to $C$ of the tangent bundle  of $\PP^3$  by the tangent bundle $T_C$) is 
$$
\cN_{C/\PP^3} \cong \cO_{\PP^1}(5) \oplus  \cO_{\PP^1}(5).
$$
Hint: for any point $p \in C$, let $L_p \subset \cN_{C/\PP^3}$ be the sub-line bundle of $\cN_{C/\PP^3}$ whose fiber over any point $q \neq p \in C$ is the one-dimensional subspace of $(\cN_{C/\PP^3})_q$ spanned by the line $\overline{p,q}$. (This of course only defines a sub-line bundle of $\cN_{C/\PP^3}$ over $C \setminus \{p\}$, but there is a unique extension to a sub-line bundle of $\cN_{C/\PP^3}$ over all of $C$.) Show that for $p \neq p'$ we have
$$
\cN_{C/\PP^3} = L_p \oplus L_{p'}.
$$
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Let $\PP^1 \hookrightarrow C \subset \PP^d$ be a rational normal curve. Show that the normal bundle $\cN_{C/\PP^d}$  is 
$$
\cN_{C/\PP^d} \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^{d-1} \cO_{\PP^1}(d+2).
$$
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
In the situation of the preceding problem, the set  of direct summands of $\cN_{C/\PP^d} $ is a projective space $\PP^{d-2}$. How does the  group of automorphisms of $\PP^d$ carrying $C$ to itself act on this $\PP^{d-2}$?

\end{exercise}

\subsubsection{Interpolation for rational normal curves}

Another remarkable property of rational normal curves is expressed in the following Proposition. Recall that a collection of points (or a finite subscheme)
of $\PP^n$ is said to be in \emph{linearly general position} if no $k+1$ of them lie in a $(k-1)$-plane with $k\leq n$. 

\begin{proposition}\label{points on rnc}
If $p_1,\dots, p_{n+3} \in \PP^n$ are any $n+3$ points in $\PP^n$ in linearly general position, then there exists a unique rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^n$ containing them.
 \end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
To start, we observe that there is an automorphism $\Phi : \PP^n \to \PP^n$ carrying the points $p_1,\dots,p_{n+1}$ to the coordinate points $(0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots,0)\in \PP^n$ and the point $p_{n+2}$ to the point $(1,1\dots,1)$.  denote the images of the remaining  points $p_{n+3}$  by $[\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_n]$. We consider maps $\PP^1 \to \PP^n$ given in terms of an inhomogeneous coordinate $z$ on $\PP^1$ by
$$
z \mapsto \left( \frac{1}{z - \nu_0}, \frac{1}{z - \nu_1} , \dots, \frac{1}{z - \nu_n}  \right)
$$
with $\nu_0,\dots,\nu_n$ any distinct scalars. Clearing denominators, we see that the image of such a map is a rational normal curve, and it passes through the $n+1$ coordinate points of $\PP^n$, which are the images of the points $z = \nu_0, \dots, \nu_n \in \PP^1$. Moreover, the image of the point $z = \infty$ at infinity is the point $(1,1, \dots,1)$; and we can adjust the values of $\nu_0,\dots,\nu_n$ so that the image of the point $z = 0$ is $(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_n)$. This proves existence; we leave uniqueness as the Exercise~\ref{Castelnuovo uniqueness}. 
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{Castelnuovo uniqueness}
Show that if $C, C' \subset \PP^n$ are two rational normal curves and $\#(C \cap C') \geq n+3$, then $C = C'$. (Hint: use induction on $n$.)
\end{exercise}

There is another way to prove Proposition~\ref{points on rnc} that may provide more insight (it actually produces the equations defining the rational normal curve through the points $p_1,\dots,p_{n+3}$); this is described in \cite{Montreal}. 

We remark that for any family of curves in projective space $\PP^r$ (for example, a component of the family of all smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\PP^r$) and any integer $m$, we can ask whether there exists a curve in the family passing through $m$ given general points of $\PP^r$. This is the only example we know of curves other than complete intersections for which there is a \emph{unique} such curve.

\begin{exercise}\label{rnc and representations}
Let $V = \CC\cdot e_1\oplus \CC\cdot e_2$ be a 2-dimensional vector space. 

The group $SL_2= SL(V)$ acts on the rational normal curve of degree $d$ through automorphisms induced from its action on
 on the ambient space $\PP^d$ of the rational normal curve, which may be identified with $\PP(\Sym^d(V))$.

Recall that every finite dimensional rational 
representation of $V$ is a direct sum of representations of the form $\Sym^e(V)$ for various $e\geq 0$. Moreover, it is often easy to understand
how a given representation decomposes by looking at the action of
$$
\alpha := \begin{pmatrix}
t&0\\
0&t^{-1}
\end{pmatrix}
\in SL(V).
$$
Note that $\Sym^e(V)$ is spanned by ``weight vectors" ($\equiv$ eigenvectors of $\alpha$) $w_s := e_1^{e-s} e_2^{s}$ 
which satisfy $\alpha w_s = t^{e-2s}$ for $s = 0, \dots e$.
To decompose an arbitrary representation $W$, knowing that $W$ is a direct sum of $\Sym^{e_i}V$, it is enough to know the 
eigenvalues for the action of $\alpha$: We begin by finding an element $w\in W$ that
is an eigenvector of $\alpha$ and transforms by $\alpha$ as
as $\alpha w = t^mw$ with the highest possible $m$ (this is called a ``highest weight vector''). This element $w$ must be contained
in a summand $\Sym^m(V)$, and after removing the eigenvalues of the action of $SL_2$ on $\Sym^m(V)$, we continue. See~\cite[Chapter ****]{Fulton-Harris}
for more information.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Use this method to show that 
\begin{align*}
&\Sym^d(V)\otimes Sym^d(V)= \Sym^{2d}(V) \oplus  \Sym^{2d-2}(V) \oplus \Sym^{2d-4}(V) \cdots\\
 &\Sym^2(\Sym^d(V))= \Sym^{2d}(V) \oplus \Sym^{2d-4}(V)\oplus \Sym^{2d-8}(V) \cdots\\
 &\bigwedge^2(\Sym^d(V))= \Sym^{2d-2}(V) \oplus \Sym^{2d-6}(V)\oplus \Sym^{2d-10}(V) \cdots
\end{align*}
  (where we take $\Sym^{m}(V)=0$ when $m<0$
 \item Show that the space of quadrics containing the rational normal curve is a representation of $SL_2$ of the form
 $$
 \Sym^{2d-4}(V)\oplus \Sym^{2d-8}(V) \cdots
 $$
  \item Show  there is a distinguished nonsingular skew-symmetric form (up to scalars) on the ambient space of the twisted cubic; in particular
  is, given a twisted cubic in $\PP^3$ there is a distinguished plane containing each point of $\PP^3$.
 \item Show that if $d$ is divisible by 4 there is a distinguished quadric in the ideal of the rational normal curve.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\subsection{Other rational curves}

What about other rational curves in projective space? 

Any linear series $\cD$ of degree $d$ on $\PP^1$ is a subseries of the complete series $|\cO_{\PP^1}(d)|$, so any map $\phi : \PP^1 \to \PP^r$ of degree $d$ may be given as the
composition of the embedding $\phi_d : \PP^1 \to \PP^d$ of $\PP^1$ as a rational normal curve with a linear projection $\pi : \PP^d \to \PP^r$. Since the natural degree $d$ Veronese embedding of $\PP^1 = \PP(V)$ as the rational normal curve is the map
$\PP(V) \to \PP(\Sym^d(V))$, the projection is a map into $\PP(W)$, where $W\subset \Sym^d(V)$. 

We can make this more explicit in several ways: first, choosing a basis $s,t$ for $V$ and a basis of forms $F_i$ of degree $d$ on $\PP^1$ for $W$, we may write the map as
$$
(s,t) \; \mapsto \; (F_0(s,t), \dots, F_r(s,t)).
$$
If the $F_i$ have a greatest common factor $G(s,t)$ then the set $G=0$ will be the base locus
of the linear system, and the map
$$
(s,t) \; \mapsto \; ( \frac{F_0(s,t)}{(G(s,t)}, \dots, \frac{F_r(s,t)}{(G(s,t)}).
$$
gives the same map, represented as a linear system of lower degree $d-\deg G$. Thus we
will now assume that the forms in $W$ have no common factor.

Perhaps even simpler, we can pass to an open affine set $\AA^1$ given by $t=1$ iin $\PP^1$, with coordinate function $z = s/t$ and
dehomogenize the $F_i$ to get a vector space of polynomials $f_i = F(s,1)$ of degree $\leq d$. Then we may write the
map as
$$
z \; \mapsto \; (f_0(z), \dots, f_r(z)).
$$
Since the $F_i$ have no common factor, and in particular are not all divisible by $t$, at least one of the
$f_i$ will have degree exactlly $d$; and since $\CC[z]$ is a principle ideal domain, any set of 
polynomials with no common divisor generats an ideal containing 
1 so after reordering the coefficients of $\PP^r$ write the map as
$$
z \; \mapsto \; (1, f'_1(z), \dots, f'_r(z)).
$$
or even
$$
\AA^1 \ni z \mapsto \; (f_1(z), \dots, f_r(z))\in \AA^n
$$
where again the polynomials $f_i'$ have degrees $\leq d$, and at least one has degree $d$.
For example, the twisted cubic itself can be represented by the map
$z \mapsto (z,z^2,z^3)$.

Here, we think of a polynomial $f(z) = f(s/t)$ of degree $\leq d$ as a rational function on $\PP^1$ having
a pole of order at most $d$ at the point at infinity $(1,0)\in \PP^1$; but we could also take rational
functions $F_i(s,t)/G_i(s,t)$ of total degree $\deg F_i-\deg G_i = d$ or, dehomogenizing, $\phi_i(z) = f_i(z)/g_i(z)$.

\subsection *{Smooth rational quartics}
Given how easy it is to describe rational curves in projective space in this way, it is surprising how many open questions there are. We begin with
one of the simplest cases: a smooth nondegenerate rational curve $C$ of degree $4$ in $\PP^3$.
As described abover, such a curve is the image of $\PP^1$ under a map given by 4 quartic forms,
or, in the most coordinate-free formulation, a codimension 1 subspace of $\Sym^4(V)$, where
$V\cong \CC^2$.

Our analysis of this case follows a pattern that we will repeat in many other situations in the next
chapters. We first ask what surfaces contain such a curve $C$---that is, what forms on $\PP^3$ vanish on $C$. 

\begin{proposition}
If $C\subset \PP^3$ is a smooth rational quartic curve, then $C$ lies on a smooth quadric
surface $Q=0$ and the homogenous ideal of $C$ is minimally
generated by $Q$ and three cubic forms.
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
We first consider the maps restriction maps
$$
\rho_e: H^0(\op3e) \to H^0(\cO_C(e)).
$$
Since we assume that $C$ is smooth, thus $C\cong \PP^1$,
we may identify $H^0(\cO_C(e))$ with $H^0(\op1{4e})$.
 Since we assume that $C$ is nondegenerate, it does not lie on a hyperplane,
 so for $\rho_1$ is a monomorphism. 
 
The source $H^0(\op32)$ of $\rho_2$ is 10-dimensional, and the target $H^0(\op18)$ is
9-dimensional, so $\rho_2$ has a kernel of dimension at least 1; that is, $C$ lies on
a quadric surface, and since $C$ is irreducible and nondegenerate, any quadric surface containing
$C$ is irreducible, and must in fact be smooth. This is a special case of 
Theorem~\ref{end of Ch 10}, and the reader may work it out in Exercise~\ref{quartic on quadric} below.
Given that $C$ lies on a smooth quadric $Q=0$, we consider its divisor class $(a,b)$ in the 
Picard group $\Pic(Q) = \ZZ\oplus \ZZ$.
\end{proof}
Finally, we have to show that the quadric $Q$ containing the curve $C$ cannot be a cone over a conic plane curve. 

%One way to do this would be to carry out an analysis, along the lines of the one above in the case $Q$ is smooth, on the desingularization $\tilde Q$ of a quadric cone $Q$. (This is obtained simply by  blowing up $Q$ at the vertex.) In other words, we could determine the Picard group $\Pic(\tilde Q)$, with its intersection pairing and canonical class $K_{\tilde Q}$; we could then ask what the class of the proper transform $\tilde C$ of $C$ in $\tilde Q$ could be and arrive in this way at a contradiction. We'll outline a proof along these lines in Exercise~\ref{F2} below; but this chapter's long enough already, so we'll take an ad-hoc approach.

Our approach will proceed in three steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item a smooth curve $C \subset Q$ of even degree cannot contain the vertex of $Q$;
\item a curve $C \subset Q$ not containing the vertex is the intersection of $Q$ with a surface $S \subset \PP^3$; and
\item a smooth  intersection of two quadrics in $\PP^3$ has genus 1.
\end{enumerate}

For the first assertion, suppose that the curve $C$ passes through the vertex and meets a general line $L \subset Q$ in $l$ points other than the vertex. Then the intersection of $C$ with a general plane $H$ through the vertex would be transverse and consist of $2l+1$ points, contradicting the hypothesis that $C$ had even degree. Thus in particular our quartic curve $C$ does not pass through the vertex, and hence is a Cartier divisor on $Q$.

The second observation follows from the fact that for any line $L \subset Q$, \emph{the complement $Q \setminus L$ is isomorphic to $\AA^2$}. Thus any invertible sheaf on $Q$ is trivial on the complement of $L$; accordingly, any Cartier divisor on $Q$ is linearly equivalent to a multiple of $L$. But odd multiples of $L$ cannot be Cartier divisors on $Q$, and $2L$ is a hyperplane section of $Q$, so we must have $\cO_Q(C) = \cO_Q(m)$ for some $m$. From the exact sequence
$$
0 \to \cO_{\PP^3}(m-2) \to \to \cO_{\PP^3}(m) \to \cO_{Q}(m)  \to 0
$$
and the vanishing of $H^1(\cO_{\PP^3}(m-2))$, we deduce that $C$ must be the complete intersection of $Q$ with a surface of degree $m$.

Finally, if $C = Q \cap Q'$ is the smooth intersection of two quadrics, we can (after replacing $Q$ and $Q'$ with general linear combinations of the two) assume that $Q$ and $Q'$ are smooth; applying adjunction twice (to $Q \subset \PP^3$ and then to $C \subset Q$), we arrive at $K_C = \cO_C$, so the genus of $C$ is 1.

\begin{exercise}\label{F2}
Let $Q \subset \PP^3$ be a cone over a smooth conic curve in $\PP^2$; let $\pi : S \to Q$ be the blow-up of $Q$ at the vertex and $E \subset S$ the exceptional divisor of the blow-up.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $S$ is smooth.
\item Show that the Picard group $\Pic(S)$ is freely generated by two classes, the class $f$ of the proper transform of a line in $Q$ and the class $e$ of the exceptional divisor.
\item Show that the intersection pairing on $\Pic(S)$ is given by
$$
f \cdot f = 0; \quad f \cdot e = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad e \cdot e = -2
$$
(Hint: one way to do the last of these is to show that a hyperplane section of $Q$ has class $h = e + 2f$ and use $h^2 = 2$.)
\item Show that the canonical class $K_S = -2e-4f$.
\item Show that if $\tilde C \subset S$ is a curve with class $ae + bf$, and
$C = \pi(\tilde C) \subset Q \subset \PP^3$, then
$$
\deg(C) = b \quad \text{and} \quad g(\tilde C) = a(b-a) -b +1
$$
\item Deduce that there does not exist a smooth rational quartic curve on a quadric cone.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
As a consequence of our description of rational quartic curves, show that a general $g^3_4$ on $\PP^1$ is uniquely expressible as a sum of the $g_1^1$ and a $g^1_3$
(in other words, a general 4-dimensional vector space of quartic polynomials on $\PP^1$ is uniquely expressible as the product of a 2-dimensional vector space of cubics and the 2-dimensional space of linear forms.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Show that there is a 1-parameter family of rational quartic curves in $\PP^3$ up to projective equivalence. Can you find invariants that distinguish one such curve from another? (Hint: think of a curve of type $(1,3)$ on a quadric as a the graph of a degree 3 map $\PP^1 \to \PP^1$.)
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Further problems (open and otherwise) concerning rational curves in projective space}

To begin with, we should remark that this one example of a non-linearly normal rational curve in projective space is misleading in that we can give such a complete description. For general $d$ and $r$, we have no idea what may be the Hilbert function of a rational curve of degree $d$ in $\PP^r$. Indeed, even in the limited case of $r=3$, our knowledge gives out around $d=9$.

We can, however, say some things about a \emph{general} rational curve $C \subset \PP^r$ of given degree $d$. To make sense of this, let $C_0 \subset \PP^d$ be a rational normal curve of degree $d$. As we've said, any rational curve of degree $d$ in $\PP^r$ is the projection $\pi_\Lambda(C_0)$ of $C_0$ from a $(d-r-1)$-plane $\Lambda \subset \PP^d$. If we let $\GG = \GG(d-r-1, d)$ be the Grassmannian of $(d-r-1)$-planes in $\PP^d$, and we let $U \subset \GG$ be the open subset of planes disjoint from the secant variety of $C_0$, we have a family of rational curves in $\PP^r$ parametrized by $U$ and including every smooth rational curve $C \subset \PP^r$ of degree $d$. Thus in particular we can talk about a \emph{general rational curve} of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\PP^r$, and ask about its geometry.

This is, in fact, still largely uncharted waters. Consider, for example, one of the most basic questions we might ask: what is the Hilbert function of a general rational curve $C \subset \PP^r$ of degree $d$? As in the example, this is tantamount to looking at the restriction map
$$
\rho_m : H^0(\cO_{\PP^r}(m) \to H^0(\cO_C(m)) = H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(md)).
$$
Equivalently, we're asking: if $V$ is a general  $(r+1)$-dimensional vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$, what is the dimension of the space of polynomials spanned by $m$-fold products of polynomials in $V$? We might naively guess that the answer is, ``as large as possible," meaning that the rank of $\rho_m$ is $\binom{m+r}{r}$ when that number is less than $md+1$, and equal to $md+1$ when it is greater---in other words, the map $\rho_m$ is either injective or surjective for each $m$.

This, it turns out, is true, but it is only relatively recently known: the case $g=0$, as here, was done by Ballico in **** (??), and the analogous statement for curves of arbitrary genus, which we will describe in Chapter~\ref{Brill-Noether}, was proved in 2019 by Eric Larson.

\subsubsection{The secant plane conjecture}

Another question we may ask about a curve in projective space is what secant planes it has. To frame the question, let's start with some language: given a smooth curve $C \subset \PP^r$, we say that an $e$-secant $s$-plane to $C$ is an $s$-plane $\Lambda \cong \PP^s \subset \PP^r$ such that the intersection $\Lambda \cap C$ has degree $\geq e$; if we exclude degenerate cases (for example, where $\Lambda \cap C$ fails to span $\Lambda$), this is the same as saying we have a divisor $D \subset C$ of degree $e$ whose span is contained in an $s$-plane.

Do we expect a curve $C \subset \PP^r$ to have any $e$-secant $s$-planes? The set of $s$-planes in $\PP^r$ is parametrized by the Grassmannian $\GG = \GG(s,r)$, which had dimension $(s+1)(r-s)$. Inside $\GG$, the locus of planes that meet $C$ has codimension $r-s-1$ (the locus of planes containing a given point of $C$ has codimension $r-s$); so our naive expectation might be that the locus of $e$-secant $s$-planes would have codimension $e(r-s-1)$ in $\GG$. Thus we would expect a curve $C \subset \PP^r$ to have $e$-secant $s$-planes when 
$$
e \; \leq \; (s+1)\frac{r-s}{r-s-1}.
$$
Is this true of a general rational curve? For most $e$, $r$ and $s$, we don't know!

\section{Curves of genus 1}

%Wonderful subject; refer to somewhere else. Double cover of $\PP^1$, leading to $y^2 - f(x)$. Plane cubic, quartic in $\PP^3$. Cheerful fact:  elliptic quintic is Pfaffian. Cheerful fact: any $g^5_6$ is the product of two $g^2_3$s. Get a $3\times 3$ matrix of linear forms. The image of the matrix and its transpose are $g^2_3$'s. Prove this by going to the Segre embedding $\PP^2\times \PP^2 \subset\PP^8$.

We cannot begin to describe everything that has been said or done with curves of genus 1, or \emph{elliptic curves}\footnote{Technically, an elliptic curve is a smooth curve of genus 1 with a distinguished point, called the \emph{origin}.}. They appeared, in the second half of the 19th century, as key objects in the developing subjects of geometry, number theory and complex analysis, and the literature is correspondingly rich. Though all curves of genus 0 are isomorphic to $\PP^1$ and on a given curve of genus 0 all divisors of a given degree are linearly equivalent, neither of the analogous statements holds true for curves of genus 1. The ways in which 19th century geometers dealt with this fact has shaped much of algebraic geometry.

Specifically, classical geometers observed that there was a one-parameter family of curves of genus 1 up to isomorphism, and that on a given curve of genus 1 there was a one-dimensional family of divisors up to linear equivalence. These were perhaps the earliest examples of \emph{moduli spaces}, and they were ultimately generalized to the moduli space $M_g$ of curves of genus $g$, and the Picard variety $\Pic^d(C)$ parametrizing divisors of degree $d$ on a given curve $C$ up to linear equivalence.

 Here we will focus on the geometric side, and try to describe maps of genus 1 curves to projective space. As a sort of through-line for our discussion, we will try to indicate in each case how the given projective model of a curve $E$ of genus 1 gives rise to the expectation that there is a one-parameter family of curves of genus 1 up to isomorphism. For any $d$, the automorphism group of $E$ acts transitively on the invertible sheaves of degree $d$ on $E$. In other words, if $\phi, \phi' : E \to \PP^r$ are two maps given by complete linear series $|L|$ and $|L'|$ of degree $d$ on $E$, then there exists  automorphisms $\alpha : \PP^r \to \PP^r$ and $\beta : E \to E$ such that $\phi' \circ \beta= \alpha \circ \phi$. In particular, if $\phi$ and $\phi'$ are embeddings---as will be the case when $d \geq 3$---then their images are projectively equivalent. As for the business of parametrizing invertible sheaves on a given curve $C$, we will take that up in the next chapter, and see it applied in the case of curves of genus $g \geq 2$ in Chapter~\ref{genus 2 and 3 chapter}.

\subsection{Double covers of $\PP^1$}

Let $E$ be a smooth projective curve of genus 1. If $L$ is any invertible sheaf of degree 1 on $E$, \trr says that $h^0(L) = 1$, so if we're looking for nonconstant maps to projective space we have to go to degree 2 and higher.

To start with, suppose $L$ is an invertible sheaf of degree 2 on $E$. By \trr, $h^0(L) = 2$ and the linear series $|L|$ is base point free, so we get a map $\phi : E \to \PP^1$ of degree 2. By \trh, the map $\phi$ will have 4 branch points; by the remark above, these four points are determined, up to automorphisms of $\PP^1$ by the curve $E$, and are independent of the choice of $L$.
After composing with an automorphism of $\PP^1$ we can take these four points to be $0, 1, \infty$ and $\lambda$ for some $\lambda \neq 0, 1 \in \CC$. Since there is a unique double cover of $\PP^1$ with given branch divisor (see~\ref{**}) it follows that $E \cong E_\lambda$, where $E_\lambda$ is the curve given by the affine equation
$$
y^2 = x(x-1)(x-\lambda).
$$

When are two curves $E_\lambda$ and $E_{\lambda'}$ isomorphic? By what we've said, this will be the case if and only if there is an automorphism of $\PP^1$ carrying the points $\{0,1,\infty,\lambda\}$ to $\{0,1,\infty,\lambda'\}$, in any order. This will be the case if and only if $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ belong to the same orbit under the action of the group $G \cong S_3 \subset PGL(3)$ of automorphisms of $\PP^1$ permuting the three points $0, 1$ and $\infty$. Direct computation shows that the orbit of $\lambda$ is
$$
\lambda' \in \{\lambda, \; 1-\lambda, \; \frac{1}{\lambda},\;  \frac{1}{1-\lambda}, \; \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}, \; \frac{\lambda}{\lambda - 1} \}.
$$
Now, the quotient of $\PP^1$ by the action of $G$ is again isomorphic to $\PP^1$ by Luroth's theorem, which means that the field of rational functions on $\PP^1$ invariant under $G$ is again a purely transcendental extension $K(j)$; explicitly, we can take
$$
j \; = \; 256\cdot \frac{\lambda^2 - \lambda + 1}{\lambda^2(\lambda - 1)^2}.
$$
(the factor of 256 is there for arithmetic reasons). In any case, we see explicitly that there is a unique smooth projective curve of genus 1 for each value of $j$; in particular, the family of all such curves is parametrized by a curve.

\subsection{Plane cubics}

Moving from degree 2 to degree 3, let $L$ be an invertible sheaf of degree 3 on $E$. We see from Corollary~\ref{degree 2g+1 embedding} that the sections of $L$ give an embedding of $E$ as a smooth plane cubic curve; conversely, the genus formula tells us that a smooth plane cubic curve indeed has genus 1. 

We won't delve into the geometry of plane cubics, except to point out that once more we can use this representation to argue that the isomorphism classes of elliptic curves form a 1-dimensional family. To see this, observe that the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree 3 in three variables is 10-dimensional, and the space of plane cubic curves is correspondingly parametrized by  $\PP^9$; the locus of smooth curves is a Zariski open subset of this $\PP^9$. On the other hand, by what we've said, two plane cubics are isomorphic iff they are congruent under the group $PGL_3$ of automorphisms of $\PP^2$. Since the group $PGL_3$ has dimension 8, we would expect that the family of such curves up to isomorphism has dimension 1.

\subsection{Quartics in $\PP^3$} 

Again, let $E$ be a smooth projective curve of genus 1, and consider now the embedding of $E$ into $\PP^3$ given by the sections of an invertible sheaf $L$ of degree 4. The first question we might ask is what polynomial equations in $\PP^3$ cut out the image, and as before we will do this by looking at the restriction map
$$
\rho_2 \;  : \; H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(2)) \; \to \; H^0(\cO_{E}(2)) = H^0(L^2).
$$
The space on the right---the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in four variables---has dimension 10, while by Riemann-Roch the space $H^0(L^2)$ has dimension 8. It follows that $E$ lies on at least two linearly independent quadrics $Q$ and $Q'$. Since $E$ does not lie in any plane, neither $Q$ nor $Q'$ can be reducible; thus by \bt we see that
$$
E = Q \cap Q'
$$
is the complete intersection of two quadrics in $\PP^3$. Moreover, we also see from the Lasker-Noether ``AF+BG" theorem that the kernel of $\rho_2$ is exactly the span of $Q$ and $Q'$. Thus $E$ determines a point in the Grassmannian $G(2, H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(2))) = G(2, 10)$ of pencils of quadrics; and by Bertini's Theorem, a Zariski open subset of that Grassmannian correspond to smooth quartic curves of genus 1. We can use this to once more calculate the dimension of the family of curves of genus 1: the Grassmannian $G(2,10)$ has dimension 16, while the group $PGL_4$ of automorphisms of $\PP^3$ has dimension 15, so we may conclude that the family of curves of genus 1 up to isomorphism has dimension 1.

There is a beautiful correspondence associated to quartic curves of genus 1 in $\PP^3$, which we'll describe now. Briefly: as we've seen, such a curve lies on a pencil of quadric surfaces $Q_\lambda \subset \PP^3$, and is the intersection of these quadrics. Now, among the quadrics $Q_\lambda$, exactly four will be cones, and the rest will be smooth. (``exactly four" requires an exercise). A smooth quadric has two rulings by lines; a cone has one. Thus the family
$$
\Phi := \{ (\lambda, L) \mid L \in \Pic(Q_\lambda) \text{ is the class of a ruling of } Q_\lambda \}
$$
is a 2-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$, branched over the four values of $\lambda$ corresponding to singular quadrics in the pencil. In fact, we claim

\begin{proposition}\label{rulings on pencil}
The curve $\Phi$ is isomorphic to $E$.
\end{proposition} 

\begin{proof}
First, choose a base point $p \in E$. We will construct inverse maps $E \to \Phi$ and $\Phi \to E$ as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $q \in E$ is any point other than $p$, and let $M = \overline{p,q}$. Every quadric $Q_\lambda$ contains the two points $p, q \in M$; if $r \in M$ is any third point, there will be a unique $\lambda$ such that $r$, and hence all of $M$, lies in $Q_\lambda$. Thus the choice of $q$ determines both one of the quadrics $Q_\lambda$ of the pencil, and a ruling of that quadric, giving us a map $E \to \Phi$.
\item The other direction is similarly straightforward. Given a quadric $Q_\lambda$ and a choice of ruling of $Q_\lambda$, there will be a unique line $M \subset Q_\lambda$ of that ruling passing through $p$, and that line $M$ will meet the curve $E$ in one other point $q$; this gives uf the inverse map $\Phi \to E$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

We mention this correspondence in particular because there is a beautiful extension of this to pencils of quadrics in any odd-dimensional projective space. Briefly: a smooth quadric $Q \subset \PP^{2g+1}$ has two rulings by $g$-planes, which merge into one family when the quadric specializes to quadric of rank $2g+1$, that is, a cone over a smooth quadric in $\PP^{2g}$. If $\{Q_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \PP^1}$ is a pencil with smooth base locus $X = \cap_{\lambda \in \PP^1} Q_\lambda$, then exactly $2g+2$ of the quadrics will be singular, and they will all be of rank $2g+1$. The space $\Phi$ of rulings of the quadrics $Q_\lambda$ is thus a double cover of $\PP^1$ branched at $2g+2$ points; that is, a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$.

The assertions made so far are elementary; proofs can be found for example in \cite{First Course book}. But now we have a remarkable analogue of Proposition~\ref{rulings on pencil} for any $g$: \emph{the variety $F_{g-1}(X)$ of $g-1$-planes in the base locus $X$ of the pencil is isomorphic to the Jacobian of the  curve $\Phi$}. A proof of this in case $g=2$ can be found in~\cite{Griffiths-Harris}; for all $g$ it is done in~\cite{Donagi paper}
