\chapter{Inflections and Brill Noether}
\label{InflectionsChapter}

In this concluding chapter, we want to introduce one more aspect of the geometry of linear series on curves, the \emph{inflectionary points} of a linear system,and use it to give a proof of at least half of the classical Brill-Noether theorem.

Inflectionary points in general are a direct generalization of the notion of flex point of a smooth plane curve to curves in higher-dimensional space. Just as a point $p \in C$ on a smooth plane curve $C \subset \PP^2$ is called a \emph{flex point} if there is a line $L \subset \PP^2$ having contact of order 3 or more with $C$ at $p$, a point on a smooth, nondegenerate curve $C \subset \PP^r$ will be called an inflectionary point if there is a hyperplane $H \subset \PP^r$ having contact of order $r+1$ or more with $C$ at $p$. This notion can be extended to arbitrary linear series on smooth curves (as opposed to very ample ones); we'll see below that every linear series has finitely many inflectionary points, and how to count them.


\section{Inflection points,  Pl\"ucker formulas and Weierstrass points}

\subsection{Definitions}

To start with the definition: let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, and $\cD = (\cL,V)$ a $g^r_d$ on $C$; that is, let $\cL \in \Pic^d(C)$ be a line bundle of degree $d$ on $C$ and $V \subset H^0(\cL)$ an $(r+1)$-dimensional vector space of sections.

For any point $p \in C$, we can find a basis $\sigma_0, \dots, \sigma_r$ of $V$ consisting of sections vanishing to different orders at $p$ (just start with any basis and if two elements vanish to the same order, replace one with a linear combination of the two vanishing to strictly higher order; since the order $\ord_p(\sigma)$ of any section at $p$ is bounded above by $d$, this process must terminate). The set
$$
\{ \ord_p(\sigma) \mid \sigma \neq 0 \in V \}
$$
thus has cardinality $r+1$, ands we can write it as
$$
\{ \ord_p(\sigma) \mid \sigma \neq 0 \in V \} = \{a_0,\dots,a_r\} \; \text{ with } \; a_0 < a_1 < \dots < a_r;
$$
the sequence $a_i = a_i(\cD,p)$ is called the \emph{vanishing sequence} of $\cD$ at $p$.  Finally, since $a_i \geq i$, we can set $\alpha_i = \alpha_i(\cD,p) = a_i - i$; the sequence $0 \leq \alpha_0 \leq \alpha_1 \leq \dots \leq \alpha_r$ is called the \emph{ramification sequence} of $\cD$ at $p$, and we say that $p$ is an \emph{inflectionary point} of the linear series $\cD$ if $(\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_r) \neq (0,\dots,0)$. (Note that if $\cD$ is very ample, so that it may be viewed at the linear series cut on $C$ by hyperplanes for some embedding $C \subset \PP^r$, then this coincides with the notion above: $p$ is an inflectionary point if there is a hyperplane $H \subset \PP^r$ having contact of order $r+1$ or more with $C$ at $p$.)

Finally, we define the \emph{weight} of an inflectionary point to be the sum
$$
w(\cD, p) = \sum_{i=0}^r \alpha_i(\cD, p).
$$

\subsection{The Pl\"ucker formula}

There are two essential facts about the inflectionary points of a linear series $\cD = (\cL,V)$ on a smooth curve $C$.

The first is simply that \emph{not every point of $C$ is an inflectionary point}. This may seem obvious---try to imagine a plane curve in which every point is a flex!---but in fact it's false in characteristic $p$: there exist what are called ``strange curves," smooth curves in $\PP^r$ such that every point is inflectionary. Luckily, we are in characteristic 0 here, so we don't have to worry about this phenomenon.

The second is the total number of inflectionary points, properly counted, is determined by $d, g$ and $r$. Here ``properly counted" means that we count an inflectionary point $p \in C$ $w$ times, where $w = w(\cD,p)$ is the weight of $p$; the actual formula, called the \emph{Pl\"ucker formula}, is
$$
\sum_{p \in C} w(\cD, p) \; = \; (r+1)d + r(r+1)(g-1).
$$
Proofs of these two statements can be found in a variety of sources; see for example~\cite{} (3264?). 

It should be emphasized that the Pl\"ucker formula, while extremely useful (as we'll see in the remainder of this chapter), leaves many questions unanswered: we don't know, for example, what combinations of inflectionary points are possible, or what the behavior of the inflectionary points on a suitably general curve may be.

\subsection{Weierstrass points}

As with any extrinsic invariant of a curve in projective space, we can derive an intrinsic invariant of an abstract curve by applying the notion of inflectionary point to the canonical linear series. 

We define a \emph{Weierstrass point} of a curve $C$ to be an inflectionary point of the canonical linear series $|K_C|$. This amounts to saying a point $p$ is a Weierstrass point if there exists a canonical differential on $C$ vanishing to order $g$ or more at $p$; by Riemann-Roch, this is tantamount to the condition that $h^0(\cO_C(gp)) \geq 2$, or in other words to saying that there exists a rational function on $C$, regular away from $p$ and having a pole of order $g$ or less at $p$.

We can similarly characterize all the inflectionary indices of the canonical series at a point. We see from Riemann-Roch that for any $k \geq 0$, there exists a rational function on $C$ with a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$---that is,
$$
h^0(\cO_C(kp)) > h^0(\cO_C((k-1)p))\text{---}
$$
if and only if 
$$
h^0(K_C(-kp)) = h^0(K_C((-k+1)p)); 
$$
that is, if and only if there does \emph{not} exist a regular differential on $C$ with a zero of order exactly $k-1$ at $p$. To give the classical terminology, we see from the above that there will exist exactly $g$ values of $k$ such that there does \emph{not} exist a rational function on $C$ with a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$; these are called the \emph{gap values} of the point $p \in C$, and they comprise exactly the vanishing sequence of the canonical series $|K_C|$ at $p$. Moreover, it is clear that the complement in $\NN$ of the gap values---that is, the set of $k$ such that there does exist a rational function on $C$ with a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$---for a semigroup, called the \emph{Weierstrass semigroup} of $p \in C$. Finally, the \emph{weight} $w_p$ of a Weierstrass point $p \in C$  is defined to be the weight $w(|K_C|,p)$ of $p$ as an inflectionary point of the canonical series.

From the general theory of ramification above, we see that a general point $p$ on any curve $C$ has gap sequence $(1,2,\dots,g)$, and correspondingly the semigroup $W_p = (0, g+1, g+2, \dots)$. A Weierstrass point is called \emph{normal} if it has weight 1; this is tantamount to saying that the gap sequence is $(1,2,\dots,g-1,g+1)$, or semigroup $(0, g, g+2, g+3, \dots)$. (The full Brill-Noether theorem tells us that a general curve $C$ has only normal Weierstrass points.) Finally, the Pl\"ucker formula tells us  the total weight of the Weierstrass points on a given curve $C$:
$$
\sum_{p \in C} w_p \; = \; g^3-g.
$$

There is still much we don't know about Weierstras points in general. Most notably, we don't know what semigroups of finite index in $\NN$ occur as Weierstrass semigroups; an example of Buchweitz shows that not all semigroups occur, but there are also positive results, such as the statement ([EH]) that every semigroup of weight $w \leq g/2$ occurs, and its refinement and strengthening by Pflueger (\cite{**}).

\section{ finiteness of the automorphism group}

As an application of just the basic facts about Weierstrass, we will deduce a basic fact: that the automorphism group of a curve of genus $g\geq 2$ is finite. The idea behind the argument is simple: because the Weierstrass points of a curve $C$ are intrinsically defined, \emph{any automorphism of $C$ must carry Weierstrass points to Weierstrass points}.
