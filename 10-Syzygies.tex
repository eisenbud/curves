\section{Introduction} Motivation: canonical embedding turns intrinsic invariants into projective invariants. Hilbert Function. Projective Normality; Canonical Module.

What are the projective invariants that correspond to Clifford index? Conjecturally, Green's conjecture. Inequality from Eagon-Northcott.

Hilbert Syzygy theorem, Hilbert function derivation, Unique minimal resolution, Betti table, 
\fix{ introduce tools as they are used}

\section {general adjunction formula} homological definitions of the canonical sheaf. (The canonical module as dual of a local cohomology, 
and local duality proves it's  an Ext (compare with the adjunction formula.))



\section{Castelnuovo's theorem: $2g+1$ is projectively normal.}

 Regularity in terms of resolution and in terms of local cohomology. (has the relation of local to global coho been done already?)

We'll need local cohomology, local duality, 
 Local duality, WMACE
recall the $2g+1$ theorem from Ch 4. Say that it's ACM+smooth. relate it to regularity as in "geom of syz". Say that the projective
normality of smooth CI's is really ACM for all CI's. Say that ACM is measured by the length of the free resolution.

\section{Liaison of curves in $\PP^3$.}
Rao module, Hartshorne-Rao theorem. Resolution of the rational quartic.

Genus formula by filtration: Suppose that $D$ is a complete intersection of surfaces of degrees $d_1,d_2$, and 
$C\subset D$ is unmixed of dim 1. Define $C'$ by $\cI_{C'} = (\cI_D:\cI_C)$. Prove by unmixedness that 
$\cI_C = (\cI_D:\cI_{C'})$,  and by local duality (?) that 
$$
\omega_{C'} = \cHom_{\cO_D}(\cO_C, \omega_D) = 
\cHom_{\cO_D}(\cO_C, \cO_D(d_1+d_2-4))
=  (\cI_D:\cI_C)(d_1+d_2-4).
$$
Thus there is an exact sequence
$$
0\to \omega_{C'}(-d_1-d_2+4) \to \cO_D \to \cO_C \to 0.
$$
Computing Hilbert polynomials via RR gives the genus formula.

Construction of curves with given Rao module: Bourbaki's theorem.


\section{Syzygies and the Clifford index}
Green's Conjecture, Voisin's Theorem, Ein-Lazarsfeld Theorem --- all cheerful facts. proof that low gonality implies long linear part.
\subsection{The Eagon-Northcott complex (lite)}: 
--Koszul complex.
--The inequality in Green's conjecture.
--resolutions of the rational normal curves and scrolls.
--Green's conjecture inequality.

\subsection{Low genus canonical embeddings} Schreyer's table (include $g=9$)?

\section{Cheerful facts about Stillman's problem}
