Genus formula by filtration: Suppose that $D$ is a complete intersection of surfaces of degrees $d_1,d_2$, and 
$C\subset D$ is unmixed of dim 1. Define $C'$ by $\cI_{C'} = (\cI_D:\cI_C)$. Prove by unmixedness that 
$\cI_C = (\cI_D:\cI_{C'})$,  and by local duality (?) that 
$$
\omega_{C'} = \cHom_{\cO_D}(\cO_C, \omega_D) = 
\cHom_{\cO_D}(\cO_C, \cO_D(d_1+d_2-4))
=  (\cI_D:\cI_C)(d_1+d_2-4).
$$
Thus there is an exact sequence
$$
0\to \omega_{C'}(-d_1-d_2+4) \to \cO_D \to \cO_C \to 0.
$$
Computing Hilbert polynomials via RR gives the genus formula.
