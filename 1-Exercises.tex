\chapter{Linear Systems exercises}\label{linear systems exercises}

In the following series of exercises, we are going to be working with smooth projective curves associated to a given affine curve $C^\circ := V(f(x,y)) \subset \AA^2$; this is the unique smooth projective curve containing the normalization of $C^\circ$ as a Zariski dense open subset.

For the first three exercises, let $C^\circ$ be the affine plane curve given as the zero locus of $y^2 - x^6 +1$, and let $C$ be the corresponding smooth projective curve. Note that the map $C^\circ \to \AA^1$ given by the projection $(x,y) \mapsto x$ extends to a map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$, expressing $C$ as a 2-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ branched over the points $1, \zeta, \dots, \zeta^5$, where $\zeta$ is any primitive 6th root of unity. In addition, let $p$ and $q \in C$ be the two points lying over the point $\infty \in \PP^1$.

\begin{exercise}
Verify the statements made above, and in particular the assertion that the preimage of the point $\infty \in \PP^1$ consists of two points; that is, the map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$ is unramified over $\infty$. What is the genus of the curve $C$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} With $C$ as above,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that
$$
p+q \sim 2r_\alpha \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{\alpha = 0}^5 r_\alpha \sim 3p+3q.
$$
\item Find the vector space $\cL(D)$ where $D = r_0 + r_2 + r_4$, and find the (unique) divisor $E$ on $C$ such that $E + r_1 \sim r_0 + r_2 + r_4$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

Hint: for the first part, consider the divisors of the rational functions $x-\zeta^\alpha$ and $y$. For the second, observe that the rational function 
$$
f(x,y) := \frac{y}{x^3-1} \in \cL(D)
$$
 and use Riemann-Roch to conclude that $\{1,f\}$ is a basis for $\cL(D)$.

\begin{exercise}
This exercise concerns the same curve as the preceding one. Here, we take $D$ to be the divisor $D = p + q + r_0 + r_3$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the vector space $\cL(D)$.
\item Describe the map $\phi_{|D|} : C \to \PP^2$.
\item Find the equation of the image curve $\phi_{|D|}(C) \subset \PP^2$, and describe its singularities.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
