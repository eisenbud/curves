\chapter{Scrolls and the curves on them}
\label{ScrollsChapter}
\section{ Geometric Description of surface scrolls}; lines joining 2 rational normal curves, Hirzebruch Surfaces. Mention higher-dim scrolls, but do surface scrolls in more detail: 


\begin{fact} \fix{where should this go?}
 Classification of minimal degree varieties
\end{fact}
 
  
\section{ general emb of degree $g+3$, in $\PP^3$ as divisor on a quadric of type $(2,g+1)$}

\section{ determinantal varieties}
  Map to $\PP^1$ is the line bundle defined by the cokernel. Get the VB as the pushforward of $\cO(1)$.

\section{ Linear series on hyperell curve}
 1) special linear series are mult $g^1_2$+basepoints. 2) Given an embedding, there's a union of lines. If the embedding is complete, we get a matrix...that defines the union of lines. Scrolls in all dimensions as unions of spans of divisors.
 

\section{ dim and genus of curves on scrolls.} Condition for the existence of integral curves in each class iff the int number with the directrix is >0 and the curve is not a multiple of the fiber. 

 
 
\begin{fact}
 Minimal degree varieties; as the varieties of given degree lying on the maximal number of quadrics.
\end{fact}

\section{ canonical image of a trigonal curve}
It lies on a 2-dim scroll (non -subcanonical embedding only on 3-dim scrolls).  embedding of a trigonal curve lies on the same scroll.Stratification of trigonal curves by Maroni invariants. Dimensions via automorphism groups of scrolls.
 
\section{ Statement of Castelnuovo Theorem}
