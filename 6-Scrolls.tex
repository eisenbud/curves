Some of the simplest subvarieties in projective space are the \emph{rational normal scrolls}. They appear in many contexts in algebraic geometry, and are useful, in particular, for describing the embeddings of curves of low degree and genus. 

We begin in this chapter by giving three different characterizations of these varieties, each useful in a different context: First a classical geometric construction that gives a good picture, then an algebraic description that allows one to ``find" the scrolls containing a given variety, and then a more modern geometric definition that makes it easy to understand the divisors on a scroll. Finally, we turn to some of the applications to the embeddings of curves.

In each section we will focus on the 2-dimensional case, both because this is the case that occurs in our applications, and to simplify the discussion. We will also indicate the surprisingly simple extensions to higher dimensions.

In this chapter we will refer to rational normal scrolls simply as scrolls. The third characterization we will give lends itself to a natural generalization to families of irrational ruled varieties, which we'll briefly mention, and the reader should be aware that in the literature the word ``scroll'' is used for this wider class.

\section{Some classical geometry}

Recall that the image of the map 
$$
\PP^1\to\PP^a: (s,t) \mapsto (s^a, s^{a-1}t, \dots, t^a),
$$
corresponding to the complete linear series
$|\cO_{\PP^1}(a)|$, is called a \emph{rational normal curve}; it is, up to linear transformations, the unique nondegenerate curve of degree $a$ in $\PP^a$.

Scrolls are one answer to the question: ``What is the higher-dimensional analogue of rational normal curves?'' To construct a scroll of dimension 2, we choose integers $0<a_1, a_2$ and consider  a projective space 
$$
\PP^{a_1+a_2+1} = \PP(\CC^{a_1+1}\oplus \CC^{a_2+1})
$$
with its two subspaces $\PP^{a_i} = \PP(\CC^{a_i+1})$. We choose a rational normal curve $C_i\subset \PP^{a_i}$, and we choose an isomorphism $\phi: C_1\to C_2$. We define the scroll $S(a_1, a_2)$ to be the union of the lines
$$
S(a_1,a_2) := \bigcup_{p\in C_1} \overline{p, \phi(p)}.
$$
It is not hard to prove directly that this is an algebraic variety, but as we shall soon write down its defining equations we will not bother to do so. The main point to note is:

\begin{proposition}\label{deg and codim}
Let $S(a_1,a_2)\subset \PP^{a_1+a_2+1}$ be a scroll as defined above.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The variety $S(a_1,a_2)$ is nondegenerate, and independent of the choices made in its
 definition up to a linear automorphism of $\PP^{a_1+a_2+1}$. 
 \item $S(a_1,a_2)$ has degree $a_1+a_2$, and codimension $a_1+a_2-1.$
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 
To simplify the notation, set $S := S(a_{1}, a_{2})$ and $\PP := \PP^{a_1+a_2+1}$.

\noindent{\bf 1)} The rational normal curves separately span the spaces $\PP^{a_i}$, so a hyperplane containing both of them would contain $\overline{\PP^{a_1}, \PP^{a_{2}+1}} = \PP$, proving nondegeneracy. 

\noindent{\bf 2)}  To construct $S$ we chose 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item disjoint subspaces $\PP^{a_i}\subset \PP$;
 \item a rational normal curve in each subspace; and
 \item an isomorphism between these curves.
\end{enumerate}
Elementary linear algebra shows that there are automorphisms of $\PP$ carrying any choice of disjoint subspaces to any other choice. Further since the rational normal curve of degree $a$ is unique up to an automorphism of $\PP^{a}$ the choice in (2) can be undone by a linear automorphism. Finally, any automorphism of $C_{a_{2}}$ extends to an automorphism of $\PP^{a_{2}}$, and this extends to an automorphism of $\PP$ fixing $\PP^{a_{1}}$ pointwise,
showing that $S(a_{1}, a_{2})$ is independent, up to an automorphism of the ambient space, of the choice in (3)  as well.

\noindent{\bf 3)} It is clear from our description that $S$ is 2-dimensional, and thus of
codimension $a_{1}+a_{2}+1 -2 = a_{1}+a_{2}-1$. To compute the degree, we choose a general hyperplane $H$ containing $\PP^{a_{1}}$. The intersection $H\cap C_{2}$ consists of $a_{2}$ distinct points. Thus the intersection $H\cap S$ consists of $C_{1}$ and the $a_{2}$ lines connecting 
the points of $H\cap C_{2}$ with their corresponding points on $C_{1}$; this union obviously has degree $a_{1}+a_{2}$.
\end{proof}

A completely parallel construction creates rational normal scrolls of dimension $r$. Set $N = \sum_{i=1}^{r}(a_{i}+1)$, where each $a_{i}>0$ and
decompose $\CC^{N}$ as
$$
\CC^{\sum_{i=1}^{r}(a_{i}+1)} = \oplus_{i=1}^{r}\CC^{a_{i}+1}.
$$
Let $\PP^{a_{i}}\subset \PP^{N}$ be the subspaces corresponding to the summands,  choose
rational normal curves $C_{i}\subset \PP^{a_{i}}$ and choose isomorphisms $C_{1}\to C_{i}$. 
Set
$$
S:=S(a_{1}, \dots, a_{r)} = \bigcup_{p\in C_{1}}\overline{p, \phi_{2}(p), \dots, \phi_{r}(p)}.
$$
The variety $S$ is nondegenerate of codimension $N-r$ and degree $\sum_{i}a_{i} = N-r+1$. The proof follows exactly the same line as the one we gave for $r=2$, but with more notation.

To put this result in context, we recall an elementary fact of projective geometry:
 
\begin{proposition}\label{minimal degree}
 Any nondegenerate variety of codimension $c$ in $\PP^{N}$ has degree $\geq c +1$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} We do induction on $c$, the case $c=0$ being trivial.
 Otherwise, assume that $c\geq1$. A general plane $L\subset \PP^{N}$ meets $X$ in $\deg X$
 distinct general points, which must be nonsingular points of $X$.
 
Let $p\in L\cap X$ be a point. If every secant to $X$ through $p$ lies entirely in $X$, then $X$ is a cone over $p$; but since $p$ was a general point, this would imply that $X$ is a plane, contradicting non-degeneracy. 

It follows that $\pi_{p}$ is a generically finite (rational) map from $X$ to $X' := \pi_{p}(X)$. The plane 
$\pi_{p}(L)$ meets $X'$ in the images of the points of $L\cap X$ other than $p$, so
$\deg X>\deg X'$. But 
$\dim X' = \dim X$, so by induction, $\deg X' \geq \codim X'+1 = \codim X$. 
\end{proof}

Thus we see that scrolls are \emph{varieties of minimal degree}. A celebrated Theorem of Del Pezzo (for surfaces) and Bertini (in general) classifies such varieties:

\begin{theorem}\label{classification of scrolls}
 Any nondegenerate variety of minmal degree in $\PP_{k}^{N}$, for any algebraically closed field $k$, is either a scroll or the Veronese surface in $\PP^{5}$ or a cone over one of these.
\end{theorem}

A proof will be given in an appendix to this chapter.

\section{1-generic matrices and scrolls}
One way to define a rational normal scroll is to say that it is the variety cut out by the $2\times 2$ minors of a $2\times m$ matrix of linear forms satisfying the following non-degeneracy condition: 
\begin{definition}
 A matrix of linear forms is said to be \emph{1-generic} if, even after arbitrary row and column transformations, it's entries are all non-zero. Note that if a $2\times n$ matrix
 $M$ of linear forms has rank 2 and is not 1-generic, then the ideal $I_2(M)$ generated by the $2\times 2$ minors of $M$ contains the product of 2 linear forms, and thus is not prime.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{rational normal scroll} (over an algebraically closed field) is a variety defined by the ideal of $2\times 2$ minors
of a 1-generic matrix. 
\end{definition}
For example, the matrix 
$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
 x &y\\
 z&x
\end{pmatrix}
$$
over $\CC[x,y,z]$ is  1-generic, since
$\det M = x^2-yz$ is irreducible. The corresponding variety, the conic in $\PP^2$,
is a rational normal curve.

On the other hand, the matrix
$$
M' = \begin{pmatrix}
 x &y\\
 -y&x
\end{pmatrix}
$$
over $\CC[x,y]$ is not, since
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0\\
-i&1 
\end{pmatrix}
M'
\begin{pmatrix}
 1&0\\
 i&1
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
 x+iy&0\\
 0&x-iy
\end{pmatrix}
$$
(but note that it would be 1-generic if we restricted scalars to $\RR$---thus the definition depends on the field).

In practice, 1-generic matrices arise in the following way. Let $X$ be
an irreducible, reduced variety, and suppose that $(\cL, V)$ is a linear series. Suppose that we there are two linear series $(\cL_1,V_1),  (\cL_2,V_2)$ on $X$
such that $\cL = \cL_1\otimes\cL_1$ and $V_1\otimes V_2 \subset V$. If we
choose
bases $\{u_i\}$ of $V_1$ and $\{v_j\}$ of $V_2$ then we may regard $\ell_{i,j}:=u_iv_j\in V$
as a linear form on $\PP(V)$.

\begin{proposition}\label{some generators}
 With notation above, the $\dim V_1 \times \dim V_2$ matrix 
$M :=  (\ell_{i,j})$ is 1-generic. Moreover, its $2\times 2$ minors are contained in 
the image of $X$ under the linear series $(cL, V)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The entries of $M$, after any row and column operations, have the form $uv$, where
$u$ and $v$ are nonzero sections of $\cL_1$ and $\cL_2$, respectively. Since $X$ is irreducible and reduced, $u$ and $v$ can vanish only on nowhere dense subsets of $X$, so $uv$ is a nozero.

We may regard all the sections of the line bundles as elements of the 
field of rational functions on $X$, so a $2\times 2$ minor 
$$
\det
\begin{pmatrix}
 \ell_{i,j}&\ell_{i,j'} \\
 \ell_{i',j}&\ell_{i',j'}
\end{pmatrix}
= (u_iv_j)(u_{i'}v_{j'}) - (u_{i}v_{j'}) (u_{i'}v_{j})
$$
vanishes on $X$ by the associativity of multiplication.
\end{proof}

Consider, for example, a rational normal curve $C$ of degree $a$ in $\PP^a$, with $a\geq 2$, 
the image of the complete linear series $|\cL|$ with $\cL = \cO_{\PP^1}(a).$ 
We can  write $\cL = \cL_1\otimes \cL_2$ in many ways, for example with
$\cL_1 = \cO_{\PP^1}(1), \cL_2 = \cO_{\PP^1}(a-1)$, and taking
$V_i = \HH^0(\cL_i)$ we have $V_1V_2 = \HH^0(\cL)$. Choosing bases
\begin{align*}
\{s,t\} &\subset   \HH^0(\cL_1)\\
\{s^{a-1}, s^{a-2}t, \dots, t^{a-1}\} &\subset \HH^0(\cL_i)\\
\end{align*}
writing $z_i = s^{a-i}t^i$, we see that the corresponding 1-generic matrix is
$$
M_a:= \begin{pmatrix}
 z_0&z_1&\dots&z_{a-1}\\
 z_1&z_2&\dots&z_{a}\\
\end{pmatrix}.
$$


\begin{theorem}Let $M$ be a 1-generic $2\times a$ matrix of linear forms on $\PP^n$, and
let $I = I_2(M)$  be the ideal generated by the $2\times 2$ minors of $M$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $n=a$, and 
$$
M = M_a:= \begin{pmatrix}
 z_0&z_1&\dots&z_{a-1}\\
 z_1&z_2&\dots&z_{a}\\
\end{pmatrix},
$$
then
$I$ is the homogeneous ideal of the rational
normal curve.

\item If $n = a$ then the 1-generic matrix
$M$ is equivalent up to row and column transformations to the matrix $M_{a}$;
in particular, $I$ is prime and $V(I)$ is a rational normal
curve of degree $a$.

\item Independently of $n$, the ideal $I$ is
prime, and the variety $V = V(I) \subset \PP^n$ has degree $a$ and codimension $a-1$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} (1) The homogeneous ideal $J$ of $C$ is the kernel of the ring homomorphism
$$
\psi: S:= \CC[z_0,\dots,z_a] \to \CC[s,t]; \quad z_i \mapsto s^{a-i}t^i.
$$
 and
the coordinate ring $S_C = S/J$ is isomorphic to the ring spanned by
monomials in $s,t$ that have degree a multiple of $a$. Such
a monomial may be written uniquely as a power of
$s^a$
times a power of $t^a$ times a monomial $s^{a-i}t^i$ with $1\leq i\leq a-1$.

Let $I$ be the ideal $I_2(M_a)$ of $2\times 2$ minors of $M_a$. By Proposition~\ref{some generators} we have $I\subset J$. Thus to prove $I=J$ it suffices to show that
every monomial m in the $z_i$ can be written, modulo $I$, in the form
$z_0^pz_iz_a^q$ for some $p,q$ and $1\leq i\leq a-1$; that is, we never need to
use more than the first power of a single variable in the set $\{z_1,\dots, z_{a-1}\}$.

Suppose that $m$ is a monomial that cannot be so expressed, so that $m$contains $z_iz_j$ as a factor, with $1\leq i\leq j\leq a-1$. We do induction on $i$. Since
$M_a$ contains the submatrix
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
 z_{i-1} & z_{j}\\
 z_i & z_{j+1}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
we see that $z_iz_j \equiv z_{i-1}z_{j+1} \mod I$, completing the argument.

(2)use Lemma~\ref{size of 1-generic} prove that the (s,t)-generalized row
defines a point on a nondegenerate curve of degree $a$, thus a RNC; wlog \emph{the} RNC. First row: independent
forms van at (1,0), so $s^{a}\dots,st^{a-1}$. Now second row proportional to $s^{a-1}\dots,t^{a}$.

3) induct on number of vars. Mod a general lin form get a prime of correct. Show this is enough.

\end{proof}




\begin{lemma} \label{size of 1-generic}
There exist 1-generic $p\times q$ matrices of linear forms in $n+1$ variables over $\CC$ (or any algebraically closed field) if and only if $n\geq p+q$;
In particular, the dimension of the space of linear forms spanned by the $1\times 1$ minors of a  1-generic matrix $M$ of size $p\times q$ is at least $p+q-1$. Moreover, if this space of linear forms has dimension $>p+q-1$, then the restriction of $M$ to a general hyperplane is still 1-generic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If we think of a polynomial ring $\CC[z_0,\dots,z_n]$ as the symmetric algebra
of a vector space $V$ of rank $n+1$, then we may regard a $p\times q$ matrix of
linear forms $M$ as coming from a map $m: \CC^{p}\otimes \CC^{q}\to V$. The matrix is 1-generic
if and only if no ``pure'' tensor $r\otimes s$ goes to zero, that is, iff the kernel $K$ of $m$ intersects the cone of
pure tensors only in 0. The cone of pure tensors is the cone over the Segre embedding of $\PP^{p-1}\times \PP^{q-1}$, 
an thus has dimension $(p-1)+(q-1)+1$. Thus a general subspace $K$ of codimension $\geq p+q-1$ will intersect the cone
only in 0, but any larger subspace $K$ will intersect the cone non-trivially,  and the first two statements follow.

Moreover, if $K$ is any space of codimension $>p+q-1$ that intersects the cone only in 0, then the general subspace $K'\supset K$
of dimension one larger still intersects the cone only in 0, proving the last statement.
\end{proof}

Note that the argument given is the the same as the proof of the bound in Clifford's Theorem: if $\cL$ is a special
line bundle on a curve $C$ then the map 
$$
\HH^0(\cL) \otimes \HH^0(\cL^{-1}\otimes \omega_C) \to \HH^0 (\omega_C)
$$
is 1-generic by Proposition~\ref{some generators}, and thus
$$
h^0(\cL)+h^1(\cL)-1 \leq g.
$$
By Riemann-Roch,  $h^1(\cL) = h^0(\cL) -d+g-1$, so this last relation becomes
$h^0(\cL)+(h^0(\cL) -d+g-1) -1 \leq g$, or $2(h^0(\cL)-1) \leq d$.

In general, if $a_1,\dots, a_m$ is a sequence of non-negative integers, we define the  \emph{rational normal scroll $S(a_1,\dots, a_m)$} 
to be the subvariety of dimension $m$ in $\PP^{\sum_i a_i+m-1}$ constructed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Write $\CC^{\sum_i a_i+m} = \oplus_{i=1}^m\CC^{a_i+1}$ 
$$
\PP^n \supset \coprod_{i= 1}^m V_i; \quad \hbox{where} \quad V = \oplus_{i= 1}^m V_i.

\item For each $i = 1...m$, choose an isomorphism

 be the union of the linear spaces

$$
spanned by sets of corresponding point on the curves $C_{a_i}$.

\section{Hyperelliptic curves}

In our early encounters with curves, we frequently assumed that the curve we were consider was non-hyperelliptic, since the behavior of hyperelliptic curves is so atypical. In this section, we'll describe the geometry of hyperelliptic curves.

\subsection{Basic models of hyperelliptic curves}\fix{move this section to ch 2; add discussion of adjoints--- perhaps as exercises?}

We start by establishing some basic facts about hyperelliptic curves. Many of these follow from general theorems like Riemann-Roch; but since they can be established by direct examination we will carry that out here.

Suppose $C$ is a smooth, projective hyperelliptic curve of genus $g \geq 2$. By definition, $C$ admits a degree 2 map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$; and as we've observed (\ref{**}) this map is unique.

By Riemann-Hurwitz, \fix{attibution?} the map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$ will have $2g+2$ distinct simple branch points, say $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_{2g-2} \in \PP^1$. An open subsect $C^\circ$ of $C$ can then be realized as the smooth projective completion of the affine curve given as
$$
C^\circ = \big\{ (x,y) \in \AA^2 \; \mid \; y^2 = \prod_{i=1}^{2g+2} (x - \lambda_i) \big\}.
$$ 
\fix{if two of the $\lambda_i$ coinncide, then the curve develops a singular point. Much of what we will do carries over to the singular case.} \fix{say the smooth model has 2 points at $\infty$.} Note that if we simply take the closure of this locus in $\PP^2$, the resulting curve will be highly singular at the point $[1,0,0]$, as can be seen either  directly by making an appropriate change of variables, or by invoking the genus formula for plane curves: if the closure were smooth, it would have genus $\binom{2g+1}{2}$. We can, however, complete the curve simply in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$, for example by setting \fix{this is a rabbit from a hat. Consider either saying that by the previous section, if there's an emb in P3 then its on P1 x P1 as a divisor of type
2,g+1; and then "finding" this embedding as below; or moving this page to the early place where hyperelliptic curves are first mentioned.}
$$
y' = \frac{y}{\prod_{i=1}^{g+1} (x - \lambda_i)};
$$
we can then write the equation of a still smaller open subset of $C$ as
$$
{y'}^2 \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{g+1} (x - \lambda_i) \; = \; \prod_{i=g+2}^{2g+2} (x - \lambda_i).
$$
If we now take the closure of this locus in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$, we get a curve of type $(2,g+1)$ on $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$; this curve is smooth, as can be seen again either directly in coordinates or by invoking the genus formula for curves on $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$. In other words,
$$
C \; = \; V\Big(Y_0^2\cdot \prod_{i=1}^{g+1} (X_1 - \lambda_iX_0) - Y_1^2 \cdot \prod_{i=g+2}^{2g+2} (X_1 - \lambda_iX_0) \Big)
$$

Next, let's describe the space of regular differentials on $C$. For this, it's convenient to work with the affine model $C^\circ = V(f) \subset \AA^2$, where
$$
f(x,y) = y^2 - \prod_{i=1}^{2g-2} (x - \lambda_i).
$$

We'll denote the two points at infinity---that is, the two points of $C \setminus C^\circ$---as $p$ and $q$.

To start, consider the simple differential $dx\in \Omega_{C^\circ/k}$. This is clearly regular on $C^\circ$, with zeros at the ramification points $r_i = (\lambda_i, 0)$. But it does not extend to a regular differential on all of $C$: it will have double poles at $p$ and $q$, as can be seen either directly or by degree considerations: as we said, $dx$ has $2g+2$ zeros, while the degree of $K_C$ is $2g-2$, meaning that there must be poles at the points $p$ and $q$.

To kill these poles, we can of course divide by $x^2$ (or any quadratic polynomial in $x$). But that just introduces new poles in the finite part $C^\circ$ of $C$. Instead, we want to multiply $dx$ by a rational function with zeros at $p$ and $q$, but \emph{whose poles occur only at the points where $dx$ has zeroes}---that is, the points $r_i$.  A natural choice is simply the reciprocal of the partial derivative $f_y = \partial f/ \partial y = 2y$, which vanishes exactly at the points $r_i$, and has correspondingly a pole of order $g+1$ at each of the points $p$ and $q$ (reason: the involution $y\to -y$ fixes $C^\circ$ and $x$), and exchanges the points $p,q$. In other words, the differential
$$
\omega = \frac{dx}{f_y}
$$
is regular, with divisor
$$
(\omega) = (g-1)p + (g-1)q.
$$
The remaining regular differentials on $C$ are now easy to find: Since $x$ has only a simple pole
at the two points at infinity \fix{say why}. we can  multiply $\omega$ by any $x^k$ with $k = 0, 1, \dots, g-1$. Since this gives us $g$ independent differentials, these  form a basis for $H^0(K_C)$.


 1) special linear series are mult $g^1_2$+basepoints. 2) Given an embedding, there's a union of lines. If the embedding is complete, we get a matrix...that defines the union of lines. Scrolls in all dimensions as unions of spans of divisors.

\section{Trigonal curves}

\subsection{Special linear series on trigonal curves}

In analyzing special linear series on a hyperelliptic curve, we made crucial use of the facts that the canonical image of a hyperelliptic curve is a rational normal curve, and that any collection of points on a rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^n$ either are linearly independent or span $\PP^n$. In a similar (though necessarily less complete) way, we can use the fact that the canonical image of a trigonal curve lies on a rational normal surface scroll to describe special linear series on it.

 

\begin{lemma}
Let $S = S_{a,b} \subset \PP^n$ be a rational normal surface scroll. Any hyperplane section $H \cap S$ consists of the union of a rational normal curve $E$, which is a section of the scroll, and a union of lines of the ruling of the scroll.
\end{lemma}

Note that the curve $E$ must be a reduced component of $S \cap H$, but the lines $L_i$ may coincide, i.e., may be non-reduced components of the intersection. In the following proof, we'll assume for clarity that the lines $L_i$ are distinct (that is, $S \cap H$ is reduced); we leave it as an exercise to rewrite the proof to accommodate the remaining cases.

\begin{proof}
Let $F \in \Pic(S)$ be the class of a line of the ruling. Since $F^2 = 0$ and $H\cdot F = 1$, exactly one of the components of $S \cap H$ must have intersection number 1 with $F$; all other components must have intersection number 0 with $F$ and so must be lines of the ruling.

It remains to show that the unique component $E$ of $H \cap S$ having intersection number 1 with $F$ is a rational normal curve. This can be seen directly, but there's a shortcut. Suppose that we have
$$
S \cap H = E \cup L_1 + \dots + L_k,
$$
so that in particular $\deg(E) = n-1-k$. Since each of the lines $L_i$ of the ruling must meet $C$, we have that
\begin{align*}
n-1 &= \dim(\overline{S \cap H}) \\
&\leq \dim(\overline {E}) + k\\
&\leq (n-1-k) + k \\
&= n-1.

We conclude that $\dim(\overline E) = n-k-1$, and hence that $E$ is a rational normal curve.
\end{proof}

Note that if $S = S_{a,b}$ with $a \leq b$, we must have either $0 \leq k \leq a$ or $k = b$: as soon as $k > a$, the span of the lines $L_i$ will contain the directrix of the scroll, and so must consist of the union of the directrix with $n-1-a = b$ lines.

Now let $C$ be a trigonal curve of genus $g \geq 5$, embedded in $\\P^{g-1}$ as a canonical curve, and let $S$ be the scroll containing $C$. We want to describe special linear series $\cD = |D|$. If our linear series has base points, we can delete them; so we'll assume that $|D|$ and $|K-D|$ are base point free. Note that this implies that   both  $r(D) \geq 1$ and $r(K-D) \geq 1$. In addition, it follows by Bertini that a general divisor $D \in \cD$ is reduced, that is, consists of distinct points $p_1,\dots,p_d$.

Now, the first hypothesis, that $r(D) \geq 1$, says that the points $p_1,\dots,p_d$ are linearly dependent. The second hypothesis, that $r(K-D) \geq 1$, says that the points $p_i$ span a subspace of codimension at least 2 in $\PP^{g-1}$ They therefore lie on at least a pencil of hyperplanes; let $H$ be a general hyperplane containing $D$.




. is effective, says that the divisor $D$ lies in a hyperplane section $C \cap H$; let $H$ be a general such hyperplane. At the same time 

canonical image lies on a 2-dim scroll (non -subcanonical embedding only on 3-dim scrolls).  embedding of a trigonal curve lies on the same scroll.Stratification of trigonal curves by Maroni invariants. Dimensions via automorphism groups of scrolls.

\section{Castelnuovo's Theorem}
(Statement only) \fix{we'll need the existence of smooth curves in given classes --- base point freeness of certain divisor classes on the scroll. Theorem: bpf iff they meet both a,b rational normal curves positively. reference to Montreal? better to make a tex file of the essential bit and put it in, as appendix. or ACGH?}
