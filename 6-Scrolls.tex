\section{1-generic matrices and scrolls}
Some of the simplest subvarieties in projective space are the \emph{rational normal scrolls}. One way to define a rational normal scroll is to say that it is the variety cut out by the $2\times 2$ minors of a $2\times m$ matrix of linear forms satisfying the following non-degeneracy condition: 
\begin{definition}
 A matrix of linear forms is said to be \emph{1-generic} if, even after arbitrary row and column transformations, it's entries are all non-zero. Note that if a $2\times n$ matrix
 $M$ of linear forms has rank 2 and is not 1-generic, then the ideal $I_2(M)$ generated by the $2\times 2$ minors of $M$ contains the product of 2 linear forms, and thus is not prime.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{rational normal scroll} (over an algebraically closed field) is a variety defined by the ideal of $2\times 2$ minors
of a 1-generic matrix. 
\end{definition}
For example, the matrix 
$$
M = \begin{pmatrix}
 x &y\\
 z&x
\end{pmatrix}
$$
over $\CC[x,y,z]$ is  1-generic, since
$\det M = x^2-yz$ is irreducible. The corresponding variety, the conic in $\PP^2$,
is a rational normal curve.

On the other hand, the matrix
$$
M' = \begin{pmatrix}
 x &y\\
 -y&x
\end{pmatrix}
$$
over $\CC[x,y]$ is not, since
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0\\
-i&1 
\end{pmatrix}
M'
\begin{pmatrix}
 1&0\\
 i&1
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
 x+iy&0\\
 0&x-iy
\end{pmatrix}
$$
(but note that it would be 1-generic if we restricted scalars to $\RR$---thus the definition depends on the field).

In practice, 1-generic matrices arise in the following way. Let $X$ be
an irreducible, reduced variety, and suppose that $(\cL, V)$ is a linear series. Suppose that we there are two linear series $(\cL_1,V_1),  (\cL_2,V_2)$ on $X$
such that $\cL = \cL_1\otimes\cL_1$ and $V_1\otimes V_2 \subset V$. If we
choose
bases $\{u_i\}$ of $V_1$ and $\{v_j\}$ of $V_2$ then we may regard $\ell_{i,j}:=u_iv_j\in V$
as a linear form on $\PP(V)$.

\begin{proposition}\label{some generators}
 With notation above, the $\dim V_1 \times \dim V_2$ matrix 
$M :=  (\ell_{i,j})$ is 1-generic. Moreover, its $2\times 2$ minors are contained in 
the image of $X$ under the linear series $(cL, V)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The entries of $M$, after any row and column operations, have the form $uv$, where
$u$ and $v$ are nonzero sections of $\cL_1$ and $\cL_2$, respectively. Since $X$ is irreducible and reduced, $u$ and $v$ can vanish only on nowhere dense subsets of $X$, so $uv$ is a nozero.

We may regard all the sections of the line bundles as elements of the 
field of rational functions on $X$, so a $2\times 2$ minor 
$$
\det
\begin{pmatrix}
 \ell_{i,j}&\ell_{i,j'} \\
 \ell_{i',j}&\ell_{i',j'}
\end{pmatrix}
= (u_iv_j)(u_{i'}v_{j'}) - (u_{i}v_{j'}) (u_{i'}v_{j})
$$
vanishes on $X$ by the associativity of multiplication.
\end{proof}

Consider, for example, a rational normal curve $C$ of degree $a$ in $\PP^a$, with $a\geq 2$, 
the image of the complete linear series $|\cL|$ with $\cL = \cO_{\PP^1}(a).$ 
We can  write $\cL = \cL_1\otimes \cL_2$ in many ways, for example with
$\cL_1 = \cO_{\PP^1}(1), \cL_2 = \cO_{\PP^1}(a-1)$, and taking
$V_i = \HH^0(\cL_i)$ we have $V_1V_2 = \HH^0(\cL)$. Choosing bases
\begin{align*}
\{s,t\} &\subset   \HH^0(\cL_1)\\
\{s^{a-1}, s^{a-2}t, \dots, t^{a-1}\} &\subset \HH^0(\cL_i)\\
\end{align*}
writing $z_i = s^{a-i}t^i$, we see that the corresponding 1-generic matrix is
$$
M_a:= \begin{pmatrix}
 z_0&z_1&\dots&z_{a-1}\\
 z_1&z_2&\dots&z_{a}\\
\end{pmatrix}.
$$


\begin{theorem}Let $M$ be  1-generic a $2\times a$ matrix of linear forms on $\PP^n$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ideal $I = I_2(M)$ igenerated by the $2\times 2$ minors of $M$ is prime.
\item The variety $V = V(I) \subset \PP^n$ has degree $a$ and codimension $a-1$.
In particular, the intersection of $V$ with a general $a$-dimensional plane is a rational normal curve of dimension $a$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\fix{make the following into a proof of primeness}
\begin{exercise}\label{RNC ideal}
 The $2\times 2$ minors of $M_a$ generate the ideal of the rational normal curve of degree $a$
\end{exercise}


\begin{proof} Let $C\subset \PP^a$ be the curve
The parametrization $\PP^1 \to C$  corresponds to the map of rings
$$
\psi: S:= \CC[z_0,\dots,z_a] \to \CC[s,t]; \quad z_i \mapsto s^{a-i}t^i.
$$
Thus the homogeneous ideal $J$ of $C$ is the kernel of $\psi$, and
the coordinate ring $S_C = S/J$ is isomorphic to the ring spanned by
monomials in $s,t$ that have degree a multiple of $a$. Such
a monomial may be written uniquely as a power of
$s^a$
times a power of $t^a$ times a monomial $s^{a-i}t^i$ with $1\leq i\leq a-1$.

Let $I$ be the ideal $I_2(M_a)$ of $2\times 2$ minors of $M_a$. By Proposition~\ref{some generators} we have $I\subset J$. Thus to prove $I=J$ it suffices to show that
every monomial m in the $z_i$ can be written, modulo $I$, in the form
$z_0^pz_iz_a^q$ for some $p,q$ and $1\leq i\leq a-1$; that is, we never need to
use more than the first power of a single variable in the set $\{z_1,\dots, z_{a-1}\}$.

Suppose that $m$ is a monomial that cannot be so expressed, so that $m$contains $z_iz_j$ as a factor, with $1\leq i\leq j\leq a-1$. We do induction on $i$. Since
$M_a$ contains the submatrix
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
 z_{i-1} & z_{j}\\
 z_i & z_{j+1}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
we see that $z_iz_j \equiv z_{i-1}z_{j+1} \mod I$, completing the argument.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}\label{RNC ideal}
 The $2\times 2$ minors of $M_a$ generate the ideal of the rational normal curve of degree $a$
\end{proposition}


\begin{lemma} \label{size of 1-generic}
There exist 1-generic $p\times q$ matrices of linear forms in $n+1$ variables over $\CC$ (or any algebraically closed field) if and only if $n\geq p+q$;
In particular, the dimension of the space of linear forms spanned by the $1\times 1$ minors of a  1-generic matrix $M$ of size $p\times q$ is at least $p+q-1$. Moreover, if this space of linear forms has dimension $>p+q-1$, then the restriction of $M$ to a general hyperplane is still 1-generic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If we think of a polynomial ring $\CC[z_0,\dots,z_n]$ as the symmetric algebra
of a vector space $V$ of rank $n+1$, then we may regard a $p\times q$ matrix of
linear forms $M$ as coming from a map $m: \CC^{p}\otimes \CC^{q}\to V$. The matrix is 1-generic
if and only if no ``pure'' tensor $r\otimes s$ goes to zero, that is, iff the kernel $K$ of $m$ intersects the cone of
pure tensors only in 0. The cone of pure tensors is the cone over the Segre embedding of $\PP^{p-1}\times \PP^{q-1}$, 
an thus has dimension $(p-1)+(q-1)+1$. Thus a general subspace $K$ of codimension $\geq p+q-1$ will intersect the cone
only in 0, but any larger subspace $K$ will intersect the cone non-trivially,  and the first two statements follow.

Moreover, if $K$ is any space of codimension $>p+q-1$ that intersects the cone only in 0, then the general subspace $K'\supset K$
of dimension one larger still intersects the cone only in 0, proving the last statement.
\end{proof}

Note that the argument given is the the same as the proof of the bound in Clifford's Theorem: if $\cL$ is a special
line bundle on a curve $C$ then the map 
$$
\HH^0(\cL) \otimes \HH^0(\cL^{-1}\otimes \omega_C) \to \HH^0 (\omega_C)
$$
is 1-generic by Proposition~\ref{some generators}, and thus
$$
h^0(\cL)+h^1(\cL)-1 \leq g.
$$
By Riemann-Roch,  $h^1(\cL) = h^0(\cL) -d+g-1$, so this last relation becomes
$h^0(\cL)+(h^0(\cL) -d+g-1) -1 \leq g$, or $2(h^0(\cL)-1) \leq d$.


\section{Other descriptions and classification}
In general, if $a_1,\dots, a_m$ is a sequence of non-negative integers, we define the  \emph{rational normal scroll $S(a_1,\dots, a_m)$} 
to be the subvariety of dimension $m$ in $\PP^{\sum_i a_i+m-1}$ constructed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Write $\CC^{\sum_i a_i+m} = \oplus_{i=1}^m\CC^{a_i+1}$ 
$$
\PP^n \supset \coprod_{i= 1}^m V_i; \quad \hbox{where} \quad V = \oplus_{i= 1}^m V_i.
$$
\item For each $i = 1...m$, choose an isomorphism 
$$
\phi_{a_i}:\PP^1\rOnto C_{a_i}\subset \PP^{a_i}\subset \PP^m
$$ 
onto a rational normal curve of degree $a_i$.
\item Let 
$$
S(a_1,\dots,a_m) := \bigcup_{p\in \PP^1} L_p
$$
 be the union of the linear spaces 
$$
L_p := \overline{\phi_{a_1}(p), \dots, \phi_{a_m}(p)}; \quad p\in \PP^1
$$
spanned by sets of corresponding point on the curves $C_{a_i}$.
\end{enumerate}

any variet varieties that occur as divisors on these play an important role in our story.
