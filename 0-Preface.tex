\chapter{Preface}

I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters mathematical,\\
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,\\
About binomial theorem I am teeming with a lot o' news,\\
With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.

---Gilbert and Sullivan, Pirates of Penzance, Major General's Song

\section{Results with which the Reader should be comfortable}

\begin{itemize}
\item definition of sheaves, schemes at the level of chapter I of \cite{GeomSchemes}; subscheme of $\PP^{n}$ is a homogeneous ideal up to saturation (Nullstellensatz).
\item definition of cohomology, cohomology of line bundles on $\PP^{n}$
\item Serre's theorem: vanishing of cohomology above the dimension; vanishing of higher cohomology of high twists
\end{itemize}

\section{Principles}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Model book: Beauville Complex Surfaces

\item 10-12 Chapters, each of 10-15 pages, each of which can be covered in 1 week (3 hours lecture)

\item Work over $\CC$, singular curves are images of smooth ones (no multiple components or embedded points.)

\item Background: able to write $H^0, H^1$, and use the terms scheme and Hilbert Function  without blushing. Assume Ch 2 of Geometry of Schemes.

\item Unproven assertions segregated in subsections labeled ``Many Cheerful Facts''.
\end{enumerate}



%\section{Outline}
% \begin{enumerate}
%
%\item Background \begin{enumerate}
%
%\item Lasker's Theorem (complete intersections are unmixed) -- sometimes incorrectly called ``$AF+BG$''
%state ci implies unmixed; prove by $H^1$ of line bundle.
%
%\item B\'ezout and the  weak B\'ezout (ex 8.4.6 in Fulton).
%B\'ezout via Koszul complex, at least in codim 2.
%
%
%
%
%\end{enumerate}
%\item Basics of curves (corresponds to material in Hartshorne Ch 4, sects 1,2,4(?)---all except elliptic curves and ``classification")
%
%\begin{enumerate}
% \item Discussion of genus of smooth curves. Riemann-Roch. Hilbert coefficient.
%
%\item Divisors and maps; canonical divisor -- cotangent bundle; canonical map as example
%Exercise: Projections from on and off a curve
%
%\item canonical series is bpf, $2g+1$ is very ample. Canonical Curves and geometric RR
%
%\item Adjunction formula for curves in a surface (Quote from Hartshorne)
%
%\item Clifford, including strong form, canonical series is va except in hyperelliptic case.
%
%\item Riemann-Hurwitz (pull back a differential form)
%
%\end{enumerate}
%%\end{enumerate}
%
%\item Families of curves and Brill-Noether theory
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Families. Define families. discuss "good and bad" families. example: symmetric product. example: plane curves of degree d. family of line bundles on a curve (or a family of curves.)
%
%\item How many curves of genus g are there? Informal discussion of moduli. 
%\item Cheerful fact about the existence of  Hilbert scheme, $M_g$, and $\overline M_g$, meaning of the phrase ``coarse moduli space''.
%
% \item Lowest degree of a covering of $\PP^1$?
% \item Lowest degree of a plane model?
% \item Lowest degree of an embedding?
% \item Number of forms of of degree d vanishing on the curve---ideals of the embeddings, Hilbert Functions.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\item Personalities
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $g=0$: rational curves as projections of rational normal curves. Rational quartic in $\PP^3$. Mention Set-Theoretic Complete Intersection problem.
%\item $g=1$. Wonderful subject; refer to somewhere else. Plane cubic, quartic in $\PP^3$, state that an elliptic quintic is Pfaffian (give proof??).
%\item $g=2$. Canonical map to $\PP^1$. Embedding in $\PP^3$ as $(2,3)$ on a quadric, ideal is 1 quadric, 2 cubics.
%\item $g=3$. Plane quartics. Sextic curves in $\PP^3$: general $g^3_6$ is an embedding, det variety.  $g\times g+1$ matrix of linear forms in $\PP^3$ gives curve of genus $g$, degree ${g\choose 2}$
%\item $g=4$. Canonical model is ci. Therefore $C$ is a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$, in 1 or 2 ways, depending on the singularity of the unique quadric in the ideal.
%\item $g=5$. Canonical model lies on 3 quadrics. Either a CI, or trigonal. In latter case, Pfaffians. Introduce Green's conjecture?
%\item $g=6$. Canonical model lies on at least 6 quadrics. We will see exactly 6, and what they are...(projective normality of canonical embedding; and Brill-Noether for the plane model with 4 nodes.) Talk about the del Pezzo.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\item Abel map and Jacobian
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $J = H^0(\omega)^\vee/\hbox{lattice of periods}$. $\dim J = g$ general $g^3_{g+3}$ is very ample. Do this as an example of Hodge Theory.
%
%\item Symmetric powers, Abel-Jacobi map, Abel's Theorem (statement), differential of the Abel map.
%\item connection with addition formulas for integrals
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\item Scrolls, Hyperelliptic curves, trigonal curves 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item general emb of degree $g+3$, in $\PP^3$ as divisor on a quadric of type $(2,g+1)$
%\item Other linear series on hyperell curve: 1) special linear series are mult $g^1_2$+basepoints. 2) Given an embedding, there's a union of lines. If the embedding is complete, we get a matrix...that defines the union of lines. Scrolls in all dimensions as unions of spans of divisors. 
%\item scrolls, starting with the matrix. Map to $\PP^1$ is the line bundle defined by the cokernel. Get the VB as the pushforward of $\cO(1)$.
%Mention higher-dim scrolls, but do surface scrolls in more detail: dim and genus of curves in each linear series. Condition for the existence of integral curves in each class iff the int number with the directrix is >0 and the curve is not a multiple of the fiber. 
%\item Minimal degree varieties; as the varieties of given degree lying on the maximal number of quadrics. 
%\item Type of scroll containing a hyperelliptic curve (Maroni invariant) --- invariant of the line bundle
%\item canonical image of a trigonal curve lies on a 2-dim scroll (non -subcanonical embedding only on 3-dim scrolls).  embedding of a trigonal curve lies on the same scroll.Stratification of trigonal curves by Maroni invariants. Dimensions via automorphism groups of scrolls.
%\item for a curve of genus 5, not cut out by quadrics:
% the intersection of the quadrics containing $C$ is two-dimensional: a rational normalscroll;  and  $C$ is trigonal, that is, a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$. 
%\item Statement of Castelnuovo theory
%
%\item Old list: Scrolls and their divisors
%\begin{enumerate}
% \item Hirzebruch surfaces embedded by complete series
% \item lines joining 2 rational normal curves
% \item determinantal varieties
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\end{enumerate}
