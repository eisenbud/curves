\chapter{Curves of genus 4, 5 and 6}\label{genus 4, 5 and 6 chapter}

This being an even-numbered chapter, we'll be analyzing the geometry of curves of low genus, specifically genera 4, 5 and 6. As before, the focus will be on understanding the linear systems that exist on these curves, and what this says about maps of $C$ to $\PP^r$. 

Now, the Brill-Noether theorem of the preceding chapter answers many of our naive questions, but we won't invoke it in genus 4 or 5; instead, we'll be analyzing the linear systems on an ad-hoc basis, observing after the fact that our conclusions agree with the general Brill-Noether theorem. In genus 6, by contrast, we'll see for the first time a question we can't answer naively; in that analysis, we will have to invoke Brill-Noether for one key fact.

One further note: As in the case of curves of genus 3, the study of curves of genus 4 or more bifurcates immediately into two cases: hyperelliptic and non-hyperelliptic. We've talked about the geometry of hyperelliptic curves in Section~\ref{hyperelliptic}, and will have more to say in Chapter~\ref{}; we'll focus here on the nonhyperelliptic case.


\section{Curves of genus 4}


In genus 4 we have a question that the elementary theory based on the Riemann-Roch formula cannot answer: are nonhyperelliptic curves of genus 4 expressible as three-sheeted covers of $\PP^1$? The answer will emerge from our analysis in Proposition~\ref{genus 4 trigonal} below.

\subsection{The canonical model}

Let $C$ be a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 4. We start by considering the canonical map $\phi_K : C \hookrightarrow \PP^3$, which embeds $C$ as a curve of degree 6 in $\PP^3$. We identify $C$ with its image, and investigate the homogeneous ideal $I = I_C$ of equations it satisfies. As in previous cases we may try to answer this by considering the restriction maps
\fix{replaced $K_C^m$ with $mK_C$.}
$$
\rho_m : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(m)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(m)) = \HH^0(mK_C).
$$

For $m=1$, this is by construction an isomorphism; that is, the image of $C$ is non-degenerate (not contained in any plane).

For $m=2$ we know that $\h^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(2)) = \binom{5}{3} = 10$, while by the Riemann-Roch
Theorem we have
$$
h^0(\cO_C(2)) = 12 - 4 + 1 = 9.
$$
This shows that the curve $C \subset \PP^3$ must lie on at least one quadric surface $Q$. The quadric $Q$ must be irreducible, since any any reducible and/or non-reduced quadric must be a union of planes, and thus cannot contain an irreducible non-degenerate curve.
If $Q'\neq Q$ is any other quadric then, by B\'ezout's theorem, $Q\cap Q'$ is a curve of degree 4 and thus could not contain $C$. From this we see that $Q$ is unique, and it follows that $\rho_2$ is surjective.

What about cubics? Again we consider the restriction map
$$
\rho_3 : H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3)) \; \to \; H^0(\cO_{C}(3)) = \HH^0(3K_C).
$$
The space $H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3))$ has dimension $\binom{6}{3} = 20$, while  the Riemann-Roch formula shows that
$$
h^0(\cO_C(3)) = 18 - 4 + 1 = 15.
$$
It follows that the ideal of $C$ contains at least a 5-dimensional vector space of cubic polynomials. We can get a 4-dimensional subspace as products of the unique quadratic polynomial $F$ vanishing on $C$ with linear forms---these define the cubic surfaces containing $Q$. Since $5 > 4$ we  conclude that the curve $C$ lies on at least one cubic surface $S$  not containing $Q$. 
B\'ezout's theorem shows that the curve $Q \cap S$ has degree 6; thus it must be equal to $C$. 

Let $G=0$ be the cubic form defining the surface $S$. By Lasker's Theorem the ideal $(F,G)$ is unmixed, and thus is equal to the homogeneous ideal of $C$. Putting this together, we have proven the first statement of the following result:

\begin{theorem}
The canonical model of any nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 is a complete intersection of a quadric $Q = V(F)$ and a cubic surface $S = V(G)$ meeting transversly along nonsingular points of each. Conversely, any smooth curve that is the complete intersection of a quadric and a cubic surface in $\PP^3$ is the canonical model of a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4.
\end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}
Let $C = Q\cap S$ with $Q$ a quadric and $S$ a cubic. Because $C$ is nonsingular and a complete intersection, both $S$ and $Q$ must be nonsingular at every point of their intersection Applying the adjunction formula to $Q\subset \PP^3$ we get
$$
\omega_Q = (\omega_{\PP^3} \otimes \cO_{\PP^3}(2))|_Q = \cO_Q(-4+2) = \cO_Q(-2).
$$
Applying it again to $C$ on $Q$, and noting that $\O_Q(C) = \O_Q(3)$, we get
$$
\omega_C = ((\omega_{Q} \otimes \cO_{3}(3))|_C = \cO_C(-2+3) = \cO_C(1)
$$
as required. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Maps to $\PP^1$ and $\PP^2$}

We can now answer the question we asked at the outset, whether a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 can be expressed as a three-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$. This amounts to asking if there are any divisors $D$ on $C$ of degree 3 with $r(D) \geq 1$; since we can take $D$ to be a general fiber of a map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$, we can for simplicity assume $D = p+q+r$ is the sum of three distinct points.

By the geometric Riemann-Roch theorem, a divisor $D = p+q+r$ on a canonical curve $C \subset \PP^{g-1}$ has $r(D) \geq 1$ if and only if the three points $p,q,r \in C$ are colinear. If three points $p,q,r \in C$ lie on a line $L \subset \PP^3$ then the quadric $Q$ would meet $L$ in at least three points, and hence would contain $L$. Conversely,  if $L$ is a line contained in $Q$, then the divisor $D = C \cap L = S \cap L$ on $C$ has degree  3. Thus we can answer our question in terms of the family of lines contained in $Q$.

Any smooth quadric is isomorphic to $\PP^1\times \PP^1$, and contains two families of lines, or \emph{rulings}. On the other hand, any singular quadric is a cone over a plane conic, and thus has just one ruling. By the argument above, the pencils of divisors on $C$ cut out by the lines of these rulings are the $g^1_3$s on $C$. This proves:

\begin{proposition}\label{genus 4 trigonal}
A nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 may be expressed as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ in either one or two ways, depending on whether the unique quadric containing the canonical model of the curve is singular or smooth.
\end{proposition}

\fix{include this?} (One might ask why the non-singularity of the cubic surface $S$ plays no role. However, $G$ is determined only up to a multiple of $F$, and it follows that the linear series of cubics in the ideal
$I_C$ has only base points along $C$. Bertini's Theorem says that a general element of this series will be nonsingular away from $C$; and since any every irreducible cubic in the family must be nonsingular along $C$, it follows that the general such cubic is nonsingular.)

A curve expressible as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ is called \emph{trigonal}; by the analyses of the preceding sections, we have shown that \emph{every curve of genus $g \leq 4$ is either hyperelliptic or trigonal}. 

We can also describe the lowest degree plane models of nonhyperelliptic curves $C$ of genus 4. 
We can always get a plane model of degree 5 by projecting $C$ from a point $p$ of the canonical model of $C$. Moreover, the Riemann-Roch Theorem shows that if $D$ is a divisor of degree 5 with $r(D)=2$ then,  $\h^0(K-D) = 1$. Thus $D$ is of the form $K-p$ for some point $p \in C$, and the map to $\PP^2$ corresponding to $D$ is $\pi_p$. These  maps $\pi_p: C\to \PP^2$ have the lowest possible degree (except for those whose image is  contained in a line) because, by Clifford's Theorem a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 cannot have a $g^2_4$.

We now consider the singularities of the plane quintic $\pi_p(C)$. Suppose as above that $C = Q\cap S$, with $Q$ a quadric. If a line $L$ through $p$ meets $C$ in $p$ plus a divisor of degree $\geq 2$ then, as we have seen, $L$ must lie in $Q$.  All other lines through $p$ meet $C$ in at most a single point,  whose image is thus a nonsingular points of $\pi(C)$. Moreover, a line that met $C$ in $>3$ points would have to lie in both the quadric and the cubic containing $C$, and therefore would be contained in $C$. Since $C$ is irreducible there can be no such line; thus the image $\pi_p(C)$ has at most double points.

We will distinguish two cases, depending on whether the quadric $Q$ is smooth or singular. But first, we should introduce a useful lemma:

\begin{lemma}
Let $L \subset S \subset \PP^3$ be a line on a surface $S \subset \PP^3$ of degree $d$. The Gauss map $\cG : S \to {\PP^3}^*$ sending each point $p \in S$ to the tangent plane $\TT_p(S)$ maps $L$ to the dual line in $\PP^3$ (that is, the locus of planes containing $L$); if $S$ is smooth along $L$ it will have degree $d-1$, and if $S$ is singular anywhere along $L$ it will have strictly lower degree.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that in terms of homogeneous coordinates $[X,Y,Z,W]$ on $\PP^3$ the line $L$ is given by $X = Y = 0$. Then the defining equation $F$ of $S$ can be written
$$
F(X,Y,Z,W) = X\cdot G(Z,W) + Y\cdot H(Z,W) + J(X,Y,Z,W)
$$
where $J$ vanishes to order 2 along $L$; that is, $J \in (X,Y)^2$. The Gauss map $\cG|_L$ restricted to $L$ is then given by
$$
[0,0,Z,W] \mapsto [G(Z,W), H(Z,W), 0, 0].
$$
The polynomials $G$ and $H$ have degree $d-1$, and have a common zero if and only if $S$ is singular somewhere along $L$; the lemma follows.
\end{proof}

Given this, we can analyze the geometry of projections $\pi_p(C)$ of our canonical curve $C = Q \cap S$ as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $Q$ is nonsingular:
In this case there are two lines $L_1, L_2$ on $Q$ that pass through $p$; they meet $C$ in $p$ plus divisors $E_1$ and $E_2$ of degree 2. If $E_i$ consists of distinct points, then, since the tangent planes to the quadric along $L_i$ are all distinct $\pi(C)$ will have a node at their common image. 

\fix{do we expect the reader to know this about quadrics, or should we prove it? or should we argue that since there are two distinct branches and a plane quintic of genus 2 can have only the equivalent of two double points, these must be simple?? The first option is probably better.}

On the other hand, if $E_i$ consists of a double point $2q$ (that is, $L_i$ is tangent to $C$ at $q\neq p$, or meets $C$ 3 times at $q = p$), then $\pi(C)$ will have a cusp at the corresponding image point. 
In either case, $\pi(C)$ has two distinct singular points, each either a node or a cusp. The two $g^1_3$s on $C$ correspond to the projections from these singular points.

\item $Q$ is a cone:
In this case, since the curve cannot pass through the singular point of $Q$ there is a unique line $L\subset Q$ that passes through $p$. Let $p+E$ be the divisor on $C$ in which this line meets $C$. The tangent planes to $Q$ along $L$ are all the same. Thus if $E = q_1+q_2$ consists of two distinct points, the image $\pi_p(C)$ will have two smooth branches sharing a common tangent line at
$\pi_p(q_1) = \pi_p(q_2)$. Such a point is called a \emph{tacnode} of $\pi_p(C)$. On the other hand, if $E= 2q$, that is, if $L$ meets $C$ tangentially at one point $q\neq p$ (or meets $C$ 3 times at $p$) then the image curve will have a higher order cusp, called a \emph{ramphoid cusp}. In either case, the one $g^1_3$ on $C$ is the projection from the unique singular point of $\pi(C)$.
\end{enumerate}

\fix{add pictures illustrating some of the possibilities above.}


\section{Curves of genus 5}

We next consider  nonhyperelliptic curves of genus 5. There are now two questions that cannot be answered by simple application of the Riemann-Roch Theorem:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is $C$ expressible as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$? In other words, does $C$ have a $g^1_3$?
\item Is $C$ expressible as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$? In other words, does $C$ have a $g^1_4$?
\end{enumerate}

As we'll see, all other questions about the existence or nonexistence of linear series on $C$ can be answered by the Riemann-Roch Theorem.

As in the preceding case, the answers can be found through an investigation of the geometry of the canonical model $C \subset \PP^4$ of $C$. This is an octic curve in $\PP^4$, and as before the first question to ask is what sort of polynomial equations define $C$. We start with quadrics, by considering the restriction map
$$
r_2 : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^4}(2)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(2)).
$$
On the left, we have the space of homogeneous quadratic polynomials on $\PP^4$, which has dimension $\binom{6}{4} = 15$, while by the Riemann-Roch Theorem the target is a vector space of dimension
$$
2\cdot8 - 5 + 1 = 12.
$$
We deduce that $C$ lies on at least 3 independent quadrics. We will see in the course of the following analysis that it is exactly 3; that is, $r_2$ is surjective.) Since $C$ is irreducible and, by construction, does not lie on a hyperplane, each of the quadrics containing $C$ is irreducible, and thus the intersection of any two is a surface of degree 4. There are now two possibilities:  The intersection of (some) three quadrics $Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$ containing the curve is 1-dimensional; or every such intersection is two dimensional. 

\subsection{First case: the canonical curve is a complete intersection}

We first consider the case where $Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$ is 1-dimensional. By the principal ideal theorem the intersection has no 0-dimensional components. By B\'ezout's Theorem the intersection is a curve of degree 8, and since $C$ also has degree 8 we must have $C=Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$. Lasker's Theorem then shows that the three quadrics $Q_i$ generate the whole homogeneous ideal of $C$.

We can now answer the first of our two questions for curves of this type. As in the genus 4 case the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem implies that $C$ has a $g^1_3$ if and only if the canonical model of $C$ contains 3 colinear points or, more generally, meets a line $L$ in a divisor of 3 points. When $C$ is the intersection of quadrics, this cannot happen, since the line $L$ would have to be contained in all the quadrics that contain $C$. Thus, in this case, 
$C$ has no $g^1_3$.

What about $g^1_4$s? Again invoking the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem, a divisor of degree 4 moving in a pencil lies in a 2-plane; so the question is, does $C \subset \PP^4$ contain a divisor of degree 4, say $D = p_1+\dots +p_4 \subset C$, that lies in a plane $\Lambda$? Supposing this is so, we consider the restriction map
$$
\HH^0(\cI_{C/\PP^4}(2)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cI_{D/\Lambda}(2)).
$$
By what we have said, the left hand space is 3-dimensional; but any four noncolinear points in the plane  impose independent conditions on quadrics, \fix{this is a scheme of length 4; how is the reader supposed to cope with this if we don't assume the notion of a scheme, at least a finite one? And does the reader really know this fact about schemes of length 4 in the plane?} so that the right hand space is 2-dimensional. It follows that \emph{$\Lambda$ must be contained in one of the quadrics $Q$ containing $C$}. 

The quadrics in $\PP^4$ that contain 2-planes are exactly the singular quadrics: such a quadric is a cone over a quadric in $\PP^3$, and it is ruled by the (one or two) families of 2-planes it contains, which are the cones over the (one or two) rulings of the quadric in $\PP^3$. The argument above shows that the existence of a $g_4^1$s on $C$ in this case implies the existence of a singular quadric containing $C$.

Conversely, suppose that $Q \subset \PP^4$ is a singular quadric containing $C = Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$. Now say $\Lambda \subset Q$ is  a 2-plane. If $Q'$ and $Q''$ are ``the other two quadrics" containing $C$, we can write
$$
\Lambda \cap C = \Lambda \cap Q' \cap Q'', 
$$ 
from which we see that $D = \Lambda \cap C$ is a divisor of degree 4 on $C$, and so has $r(D) = 1$ by the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem. Thus, the rulings of  singular quadrics containing $C$ cut out on $C$ pencils of degree 4; and every pencil of degree 4 on $C$ arises in this way.

Does $C$ lie on singular quadrics? There is a $\PP^2$ of quadrics containing $C$---a 2-plane in the space $\PP^{14}$ of quadrics in $\PP^4$---and the family of singular quadrics  consists of a  hypersurface of degree 5 in $\PP^{14}$--called the \emph{discriminant} hypersurface. By Bertini's Theorem, not every quadric containing $C$ is singular. Thus the set of singular quadrics containing $C$ is a plane curve $B$ cut out by a quintic equation. So $C$ does indeed have a $g^1_4$, and is expressible as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$. In sum, we have proven:

\begin{proposition}
Let $C \subset \PP^4$ be a canonical curve, and assume $C$ is the complete intersection of three quadrics in $\PP^4$. Then $C$ may be expressed as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ in a one-dimensional family of ways, and there is a map from the set of $g^1_4$s on $C$ to a plane quintic curve $B$, whose fibers have cardinality 1 or 2.
\end{proposition}

\fix{could the "quintic curve" be reducible/multiple? Just a line? (I think it has to be reduced, but I'll have to check)}

Of course, we can go further and ask about the geometry of the plane curve $B$ and how it relates to the geometry of $C$; a fairly exhaustive list of possibilities is given in \cite{****} [ACGH]. But that's enough for now.

\subsection{Second case: the canonical curve is not a complete intersection}

At the outset of our analysis of curves of genus 5, we saw that a canonical curve $C \subset \PP^4$ of genus 5 is contained in at least a three-dimensional vector space of quadrics. Assuming that the intersection of these quadrics was 1-dimensional---and hence $C$ was a complete intersection---led us to the analysis above. We'll now consider the alternative: what if the intersection of the quadrics containing our canonical curve is a surface?

The first thing to do in this case is to observe that \emph{the intersection must contain an irreducible, nondegenerate surface}. This will follow from Fulton's Bezout theorem, which we'll state here:

\begin{theorem}
Let $Z_1,\dots, Z_k \subset \PP^n$ be hypersurfaces of degrees $d_1,\dots,d_k$. If $\Gamma_1,\dots,\Gamma_m$ are the irreducible components of the intersection $Z_1 \cap \dots \cap Z_k$, then
$$
\sum_{\alpha = 1}^m \deg(\Gamma_\alpha) \; \leq \; \prod_{i=1}^k d_i.
$$
\end{theorem}

The point is, there's absolutely no hypothesis on the dimension of the $\Gamma_\alpha$. In our present circumstances, suppose that the intersection $X = Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$ of the three quadrics containing our canonical curve $C$ has dimension 2. If $C$ were a component of $X$, then the sum of the degrees of the irreducible components of $X$ would be strictly greater than 8, which Fulton's theorem doesn't allow. Thus $C$ must be contained in a 2-dimensional irreducible component  $S$ of $X$, and this surface $S$ is necessarily nondegenerate.

Now, in Exercise~\ref{} we saw that an irreducible, nondegenerate surface $S \subset \PP^4$ can lie on at most three quadrics, and if such a surface does lie on three quadrics it must be a rational normal surface scroll. So in this case our canonical curve is contained in a cubic scroll $S \subset \PP^4$, and we can analyze its geometry accordingly.

A rational normal scroll in $\PP^4$ is either the scroll obtained by taking the union of the lines joining corresponding points on a line and a conic contained in a complementary plane, or a cone over a twisted cubic curve in $\PP^3$. We will analyze here the former case; as we'll see in Exercise~\ref{} below, the latter does not occur.

To recall the construction of a cubic surface scroll $S \subset \PP^4$: let $L \subset \PP^4$ be a line, and $C$ a conic curve in a 2-plane complementary to $E$; we choose an isomorphism $L \cong C$, and let $S$ be the union of the lines joining corresponding points. In the Picard group of $S$, let $H$ denote the class of a hyperplane section, and $F$ the class of a line of the ruling; these classes generate $\pic(S)$, with intersection pairing
$$
H\cdot H = 3; \quad H\cdot F = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad F\cdot F= 0.
$$

We can use the method of undetermined coefficients to find the canonical class of $S$: if we write $K_S = \alpha H + \beta F$, then we can apply the adjunction formula to $F$ to arrive at
$$
0 = g(F) = \frac{F\cdot F + K_S\cdot F}{2} + 1 = \frac{\alpha}{2} + 1
$$
and we deduce that $\alpha = -2$. Similarly we can apply the adjunction formula to $H$ to obtain
$$
0 = g(H) = \frac{H\cdot H + K_S\cdot H}{2} + 1 = \frac{3 + 3\alpha + \beta}{2} + 1
$$
from which we see that $\beta = 1$; thus 
$$
K_S = -2H + F
$$
Thus, if $C \subset S$ is a smooth curve with class $\mu H + \nu F$, we have
$$
\deg(C) = 3\mu + \nu
$$
and
$$ 
g(C) = \frac{3\mu(\mu-2) + \mu(\nu + 1) + \nu(\mu - 2)}{2} + 1   = 3\binom{\mu}{2} + (\mu - 1)(\nu - 1)
$$

Now, in the case of our canonical curve $C \subset S$, we have $\deg(C) = 8$ and $g(C) = 5$, and we can solve to find that the class of $C$ is
$$
C \sim 3H - F.
$$

The key thing to note here is that the curve $C$ will have intersection number 3 with the lines of the ruling of $S$, meaning that $C$ is a trigonal curve. (We also see that the $g^1_3$ on $C$ is unique: if $D = p + q + r$ is a divisor moving in a pencil, the points $p, q$ and $r$ must lie on a line; since the surface $S$ is the intersection of quadrics, that line must lie on $S$ and so must be a line of the ruling.) We see also that the locus $W^1_4(C)$ will have two components: there are pencils with a base point, that is, consisting of the $g^1_3$ plus a base point; and there are the residual series $K_C - g^1_3 - p$. Each of these components of $W^1_4(C)$ is a copy of the curve $C$ itself, and they meet in two points, corresponding to the points of intersection of $C$ with the directrix of the scroll $S$.

In sum, we have the

\begin{theorem}
Let $C \subset \PP^4$ be a canonical curve of genus 5. Then $C$ lies on exactly three quadrics, and either
\begin{enumerate}
\item $C$ is the intersection of these quadrics; in which case $C$ is not trigonal, and the variety $W^1_4(C)$ of expressions of $C$ as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ is a two-sheeted cover of a plane quintic curve; or
\item The quadrics containing $C$ intersect in a cubic scroll; in this case, $C$ has a unique $g^1_3$, and the variety $W^1_4(C)$ consists of the union of two copies of $C$ meeting at two points.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
Verify that in both cases the variety $W^1_4(C)$ is a curve of arithmetic genus 11.
\end{exercise}

\section{Curves of genus 6}

\section{Introduction}

Throughout our analyses of curves of genus $g = 3, 4$ and 5, we have been able to analyze the geometry of the canonical model to verify the statement of the Brill-Noether theorem in each case. In genus 6, by contrast, a fundamental shift takes place: we cannot deduce the Brill-Noether theorem from studying the geometry of the canonical curve; rather, we need to use Brill-Noether to describe the canonical curve.

As usual, the first thing to consider when looking at a canonical curve $C \subset \PP^5$ of genus 6 is the space of quadric hypersurfaces containing $C$. We look at the restriction map
$$
H^0(\cO_{\PP^5}(2)) \to H^0(2K_C);
$$
once more, we know the dimensions of these spaces: on the left, we have the space of homogeneous quadratic polynomials in 6 variables, which has dimension 21; and on the right, Riemann-Roch tells us that $h^0(2K_C) = 20 - 6 + 1 = 15$, so we may conclude that \emph{a canonical curve $C$ of genus $6$ lies on at least a 6-dimensional vector space of quadrics}.

But what do we do with this information? Clearly $C$ cannot be a complete intersection; but are there interesting subvarieties of $\PP^5$ containing $C$? In this case, we cannot deduce the Brill-Noether statement from an ad-hoc examination of the geometry of $C$; rather, we need to invoke Brill-Noether in order to give a complete description of $C$.

In the remainder of this chapter, accordingly, we'll lay out the various possibilities for canonical curves of genus 6. First of all,  Brill-Noether tells us that a general canonical curve $C \subset \PP^5$ is not trigonal, but certainly trigonal curves of genus 6 exist; in the following section we'll consider the geometry of these. After that, we'll turn to the picture of a general curve $C$ of genus 6, and (using Brill-Noether) describe the various linear series on $C$ and how they arise. Finally, there are many (well, 6) cases of non-trigonal curves, the geometry of whose linear series differs from that of a general curve of genus 6, and we'll spend a little time investigating and describing those.


\section{Trigonal curves of genus 6} The picture of trigonal curves in genus 6 is very much like that of trigonal curves of genus 5, and for that matter trigonal curves of any higher genus; rather than focus here on genus 6, we'll consider a trigonal curve of any genus $g \geq 4$. 

So: suppose now that $C \subset \PP^{g-1}$ is a trigonal curve of genus $g$, and let $\cD = \{D_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \PP^1}$ be the $g^1_3$. By the geometric Riemann-Roch, the divisors $D_\lambda$ each span a line $L_\lambda$, and these lines sweep out a surface $S = \cup L_\lambda$ containing the canonical curve. The first thing to observe is the
\begin{proposition}
The surface $S$ is a rational normal scroll.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We can exhibit $S$ explicitly as follows: if $D$ is any divisor of the $g^1_3$, consider the multiplication map
$$
\mu : H^0(\cO_C(D)) \otimes H^0(K_C(-D)) \to H^0(K).
$$
By Riemann-Roch, we have $h^0(K_C(-D)) = g-2$; and indeed for any $\lambda$, if we denote by $\sigma_\lambda$ the section of $H^0(\cO_C(D))$ vanishing on $D_\lambda$ then the image of
$$
\CC \sigma_\lambda \otimes H^0(K_C(-D)) \to H^0(K)

is exactly the space of linear forms on $\PP H^0(K)^* = \PP^{g-1}$ vanishing on the line $L_\lambda$. In other words, the surface $S$ is exactly the rank 1 locus of the $2 \times g-2$ matrix representing the map $\mu$; since $\mu$ is injective on each factor, this matrix is 1-generic and the associated determinantal variety $S$ is a rational normal scroll.
\end{proof}

Given this, it's straightforward to find the class of the curve $C \subset S$. Recall that the Picard group of a scroll $S \subset \PP^{g-1}$ is freely generated by the class $H$ of a hyperplane section, and the class $L$ of a line of the ruling, with intersection pairing
$$
H \cdot H = \deg(S) = g-2; \quad H \cdot L = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad L \cdot L = 0.
$$
Writing $C \sim aH + bL$ for the class of the canonical curve $C$, we see immediately that since $C$ meets the lines of the ruling three times, we must have $a = 3$; from the fact that the degree of $C$ is $2g-2$ we have
$$
2g-2 = C \cdot H = 3(g-2) +b,
$$
from which we deduce that $b = -g + 4$. 

\begin{exercise}
Verify this by applying the adjunction formula to show that the arithmetic genus of $C$ is indeed $g$. Also, check that this agrees with our conclusions in the cases $g = 4$ and $5$ already analyzed!
\end{exercise}

The one thing we don't know is which rational normal scroll $S$ is, and indeed in genus $g \geq 6$ the isomorphism class of $S$ may depend on $C$. This information is given by the \emph{Maroni invariant} of the curve: if the surface $S$ is the scroll $X_{a,b}$, the Maroni invariant is defined to be $\mu = |b-a|$. This invariant can be interpreted in many different ways, as the following exercise describes:

\begin{exercise}
Let $C$ be a trigonal curve, with pencil of degree 3 $\cD$. In terms of the Maroni invariant, find:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The largest integer $m$ such that $m\cD$ is special; and
\item The smallest integer $k$ such that $k\cdot \cD \subsetneq |kD|$ (equivalently, the smallest $k$ such that the linear series $|kD|$ is birationally very ample).
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

Note that in genus 4 and 5 the Maroni invariant is necessarily 0 and 1, respectively. Genus 6 is the first case where the the Maroni invariant is indeterminate: it can either be 0 (meaning the scroll $S = X_{2,2} \cong \PP^1 \times \PP^1$, in which case we can realize $C$ as a curve of type $(3,4)$ on a smooth quadric surface; or it can be 2, in which case we can realize $C$ as (the normalization of) the intersection of a quadric cone $Q \subset \PP^3$ with a quartic surface passing through the vertex of $Q$.

In general, the Maroni invariant defines a stratification of the locus $T_g \subset M_g$ of the locus of trigonal curves in the moduli space of curves of genus $g$.

\section{General curves of genus 6}

\section{Other curves of genus 6}


To begin with,

To prove projective quadratic normality,  use general position: the general hyperplane section is 10 points in $\PP^4$ 8 of them lie on the union of two hyperplanes -- which won't contain the rest -- so they impose exactly 9 conditions. 

Prove monodromy of hyperplane sections is the symmetric group. Do this carefully. Explain the correspondence between monodromy and Galois theory. 

Deduce projective normality from quadratic normality.

At this point, we're stuck: we still don't know what linear series exist on our curve, or much about the geometry of the canonical model. But if we invoke Brill-Noether, we have both: the curve has a $g^2_6$, which gives us a plane model as a sextic (with only double points, since no $g^1_3$s); the canonical series on the curve is cut out by cubics passing through the double points, which embeds the (blow-up of the) plane as a del Pezzo surface in $\P^5$, of which the canonical curve is a quadric section. Also, use the count of $g^2_6$s on $C$ to deduce the uniqueness of the del Pezzo.
