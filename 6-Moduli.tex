\chapter{Moduli of Curves}
\label{Moduli chapter}

Philosophy of this chapter: the book \emph{Moduli of Curves} has already been written, and we don't want to write it again. But a summary of the basic information would be useful

\section{$M_g$}

Assert existence as a coarse, rather than a fine moduli space (say what this means and give ref to Geometry of Schemes?)

\section{Compactifying $M_g$}

Describe the Deligne-Mumford compactification; mention alternatives?

\section{Auxilliary constructions}

\subsection{Hurwitz spaces}

\subsection{Severi varieties}

Deduce: $M_g$ is irreducible of dimension $3g-3$

\section{Unirationality}

Can you write down a general curve of genus $g$?
