\chapter{Moduli of Curves}
\label{Moduli chapter}

Philosophy of this chapter: the book \emph{Moduli of Curves} has already been written, and we don't want to write it again. But a summary of the basic information would be useful

\section{$M_g$}

Assert existence as a coarse, rather than a fine moduli space (say what this means and give ref to Geometry of Schemes?)

\section{Compactifying $M_g$}

Describe the Deligne-Mumford compactification; mention alternatives?

\section{Auxilliary constructions}

It is hard to specify an abstract curve. It is much easier if the curve $C$ comes to us with some additional structure, such as a map to projective space; if the map is a birational embedding, we can specify the curve just by specifying a set of polynomial equations cutting it out. 

\subsection{Hurwitz spaces}

Fix integers $d \geq 2$ and $g \geq 0$. By the \emph{small Hurwitz space} $\cH^\circ_{d,g}$ we will mean a space parametrizing simply branched covers $f : C \to \PP^1$ of degree $d$, with $C$ a smooth projective curve of genus $g$. Here ``simply branched" means that every fiber  either is reduced---that is, consists of $d$ reduced points---or consists of one double point and $d-2$ reduced points. If a map $f : C \to \PP^1$ is simply branched, in particular, the branch divisor $B \subset \PP^1$ of the map will consist of $b = 2d+2g-2$ distinct points in $\PP^1$

What does such a space look like? The answer is easiest to see if we work over $\CC$ and use the classical or \'etale topology; in this setting, we consider the incidence correspondence
\begin{diagram}
& & \cH_{d,g} & & \\
& \ldTo^\alpha & & \rdTo^\beta & \\
U \subset \PP^b & & & & M_g
\end{diagram}
Here $\alpha$ is the map associating to a branched cover $f : C \to \PP^1$ its branch divisor, and $\beta$ the map sending $f : C \to \PP^1$ to the point $[C] \in M_g$; the open set $U \subset \PP^b$ is the open set of $b$-tuples of distinct points in the space $\PP^b$ of all effective divisors of degree $b$ on $\PP^1$.

Over $\CC$, we can describe a branched cover concretely: if we make a collection of cuts in $\PP^1$ joining a base point $p$ to each of the branch points $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_b$ of the map, the preimage in $C$ of the complement of the cuts will consist of $d$ disjoint copies of the complement of the cuts in $\PP^1$ (the ``sheets" of the cover), which we can label with the integers $1, 2, \dots, d$. In these terms, we can associate to each branch point $p_i \in \PP^1$ the transposition $\tau_i \in S_d$ exchanging the two sheets that come together over $p_i$. We arrive at a sequence of transpositions $\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_b \in S_d$, with two conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the product $\tau_1\cdot \tau_2 \cdots \tau_b$ is the identity; and
\item the $\tau_i$ together generate a transitive subgroup of $S_d$.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the sequence $\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_b \in S_d$ is determined by the cover $f : C \to \PP^1$ up to simultaneous conjugation in $S_d$: we can revise our labelling of the sheets, which has the effect of conjugating all the $\tau_i$ by the relabelling permutation.

The conclusion is simply that the map $\alpha : \cH_{d,g} \to U$ is a covering space map, which gives us our first picture of the geometry of $\cH_{d,g}$. For example, this was the basis of the first proof that $M_g$ is irreducible: Clebsch, Hurwitz and others (**??**) analyzed the monodromy of the cover $\alpha : \cH_{d,g} \to U$, and showed that it was indeed transitive; they concluded that \emph{$\cH_{d,g}$ is irreducible for all $d$ and $g$} and hence, since $\cH_{d,g}$ dominates $M_g$ for $d \gg g$, that $M_g$ is irreducible for all $g$.

The Hurwitz spaces also give us a way to estimate the dimension of the moduli space $M_g$. The point is, while it may not be immediately obvious what the dimension of $M_g$ is, the dimension of $\cH_{d,g}$ is clear: it's a finite-sheeted cover of an open subset $U \subset \PP^b$, and so has dimension  $b = 2d+2g-2$. To find the dimension of $M_g$, accordingly, we simply have to choose $d \gg g$ (so that $\cH_{d,g}$ dominates $M_g$), and estimate the dimension of the fibers of $\cH_{d,g}$ over $M_g$.

This is straightforward, based on our previous constructions. Given a curve $C$, to specify a map $f : C \to \PP^1$ we have to specify first a line bundle $L$ of degree $d$ on $C$ ($g$ parameters, as described in Chapter~\ref{new Jacobians chapter}. We then have to specify a pair of sections of $L$ (up to multiplying the pair by a scalar). By Riemann-Roch, we will have $h^0(L) = d-g+1$, so to specify a pair of sections (mod scalars) is $2(d-g+1)-1$ parameters. Altogether, we have
$$
2d+2g-2 = \dim \cH_{d,g} = \dim M_g + g + 2(d-g+1)-1;
$$
and solving, we arrive at
$$
\dim M_g \; = \; 3g-3.
$$




\subsection{Severi varieties}

The Severi varieties behave in many ways like the Hurwitz spaces, even though they differ in virtually all particulars.

Just as the Hurwitz space $\cH_{d,g}$ parametrizes pairs $(C,f)$ consisting of a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$ and a map $f : C \to \PP^1$ of degree $d$, the Severi variety parametrizes pairs $(C,f)$ consisting of a smooth curve $C$ of genus $g$ and a map $f : C \to \PP^2$ of degree $d$. As, in the case of Hurwitz spaces we restrict our attention initially to the locus where the map $f$ is simply branched, we initially make a similar restriction: we consider only those maps $f : C \to \PP^2$ that are birational onto a plane curve $C_0$ having only nodes as singularities. In this case, the curve $C$ is determined simply as the normalization of $C_0$, so we can define the \emph{small Severi variety} $V_{d,g}$ to be the locally closed subset of the projective space $\PP^N$ parametrizing plane curves of degree $d$ corresponding to irreducible nodal curves of degree $d$ and geometric genus $g$.

Since we have appended the adjective ``small" to both the Hurwitz spaces and the Severi varieties, we should explain: in both cases, one goal is to find a good compactification or partial compactification of these spaces. ``Good" here means that the larger space is still a moduli space, but for a larger class of pairs $(C,f)$. For example, in the case of the Hurwitz space, we have the \emph{space of admissible covers}, which parametrizes  maps of degree $d$ from nodal curves $C$ of arithmetic genus $g$ to nodal curves of arithmetic genus 0 satisfying certain local conditions. In the case of Severi varieties, we could simply take the closure $\overline{V_{d,g}}$ of $V_{d,g}$ in the space $\PP^N = \PP^{\binom{d+2}{2}-1}$ of all plane curves of degree $d$, but this is unsatisfactory in a number of ways: the singularities of $\overline{V_{d,g}}$ are arbitrarily awful, as are those of the curves $C_0 \subset \PP^2$ corresponding to the added points.

In fact, the Severi varieties share two key attributes with Hurwitz spaces, the first of which is that their dimensions are readily calculable. In brief, the curve $C_0 \subset \PP^2$ corresponding to a point on the small Severi variety $V_{d,g}$ will have $\delta = \binom{d-1}{2} - g$ nodes; to describe the locus of such points, we can introduce the incidence correspondence
$$
\Sigma = \{(C_0,p_1,\dots,p_\delta) \in V_{d,g} \times (\PP^2)^\delta \; \mid \; C_0 \text{ has a node at $p_i$} \}.
$$
The fibers of the projection $\Sigma \to (\PP^2)^\delta$ are linear subspaces of $\PP^N$, and either a calculation in local coordinates or a little deformation theory shows that they have the expected dimension $N - 3\delta$. We see thus that
$$
\dim V_{d,g} = \dim \Sigma = 2\delta + N - 3\delta = 3d+g-1.
$$

As in the case of Hurwitz spaces, this knowledge is enough for us to determine the dimension of $M_g$. Again, for any given $g$ if we choose $d \gg g$ the map $V_{d,g} \to M_g$ sending the pair $(C, f)$ to the point $C \in M_g$ will be dominant. And again, we can readily calculate the dimension of the fibers: if $C$ is a given curve of genus $g$, to specify a map $f : C \to \PP^2$ of degree $d$ we have to choose a line bundle $L$ of degree $d$ on $C$ ($g$ parameters), and then choose 3 global sections of $L$ up to simultaneous multiplication by a scalar. Since by Riemann-Roch we will have $h^0(L) = d-g+1$, we arrive at
$$
3d+g-1 = \dim V_{d,g}  = g + 3(d-g+1) - 1,
$$
and solving we see again that $\dim M_g = 3g-3$.

The second key attribute that the Severi variety $V_{d,g}$ shares with the Hurwitz space $H_{d,g}$ and  is that \emph{it is irreducible for all $d$ and $g\leq \binom{d-1}{2}$}. In particular, we can use the Severi varieties to prove that $M_g$ is irreducible for all $g$. It should be said, however, that it's not so easy to prove irreducibility of the Severi variety\footnote{The second author of the current volume owes his current employment to this fact.}; the fastest way to prove irreducibility of $M_g$ (in characteristic 0, at least) is still via the Hurwitz spaces.

\section{Hilbert schemes}

The Hilbert schemes---schemes $\cH_{d,g,r}$ parametrizing curves of given degree and arithmetic genus in $\PP^r$ for any $r$---are the subject of a later chapter in their own right. But it should be said at this point that the sort of regular behavior exhibited by the Hurwitz spaces and the Severi varieties is completely absent from the Hilbert scheme. Even if we restrict out attention to  what we might call the ``small Hilbert scheme"---the open subset corresponding to smooth, irreducible and nondegenerate curves---Hilbert schemes are truly wild. Locally, they can have arbitrarily bad singularities (ref to Vakil); globally, they can have many irreducible components---no one has any idea how many in general---of many different dimensions.


\section{Unirationality}

Can you write down a general curve of genus $g$?
