\chapter{Inflection points}\label{inflections chapter}
\label{InflectionsChapter}


In this chapter, we will introduce the \emph{inflection points} of a linear system. \fix{the first phrase of the next sentence seems to me weak. Maybe replace it with ``We love this topic for its echos of classical algebraic geometry;"} This is a fascinating topic in its own right and it will provide the tools to give a proof of the Brill-Noether theorem in the following chapter.

Just as a point $p \in C$ on a smooth plane curve $C \subset \PP^2$ is called a \emph{flex point} if there is a line $L \subset \PP^2$ having contact of order 3 or more with $C$ at $p$, a point on a smooth, nondegenerate curve $C \subset \PP^r$ will be called an \emph{inflection point} if there is a hyperplane $H \subset \PP^r$ having contact of order $r+1$ or more with $C$ at $p$. This notion can be extended to arbitrary linear series on smooth curves (as opposed to very ample ones). In characteristic 0 every linear series has finitely many inflection points, and the number of these properly counted, depends only on the genus of the curve and the degree of the linear series.


\section{Inflection points,  Pl\"ucker formulas and Weierstrass points}

\subsection{Definitions}
To define the inflection points of a linear series $\sD = (\sL, V)$ on a curve $C$, we will use the following result:

\begin{proposition}\label{vanishing sequence} Let $V$ be a vector space of global sections of an invertible sheaf $\sL$ on a smooth curve $C$, and let $p \in C$ be a point. There exists a basis $\sigma_0, \dots, \sigma_r$ of $V$ consisting of sections vanishing to different orders at $p$. Thus the set
$$
\{ \ord_p(\sigma) \mid \sigma \neq 0 \in V \}
$$
 has cardinality $\dim V$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} Let $\tau_0, \dots, \tau_r$ be a basis of $V$.  If  $\tau_i$ and $\tau_j$ vanish to the same order at $p$, then 
some nonzero linear combination $\tau_i' := a\tau_i+b\tau_j$  will vanish to strictly higher order. Since the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are both necessarily nonzero we may modify our basis, replacing $\tau_i$ with $\tau_i'$, strictly increasing the sum of the orders. 
The order of vanishing of each $\sigma_i$ is bounded above by $\deg \sL$, so the sum of the orders is bounded by $(r+1)\deg \sL$. Thus the process must terminate, and when it does,
 the orders must be distinct. \end{proof}

According to  Proposition~\ref{vanishing sequence}, we may write
$$
\{ \ord_p(\sigma) \mid \sigma \neq 0 \in V \} = \{a_0,\dots,a_r\} \; \text{ with } \; 0\leq a_0 < a_1 < \dots < a_r.
$$
The sequence $a_i = a_i(\cD,p)$ is called the \emph{vanishing sequence} of $\cD$ at $p$.  Since $a_i \geq i$, the numbers $\alpha_i = \alpha_i(\cD,p) := a_i - i$ are often more interesting, and the sequence $0 \leq \alpha_0 \leq \alpha_1 \leq \dots \leq \alpha_r$ is called the \emph{ramification sequence} of $\cD$ at $p$. 

We say that $p$ is an \emph{inflection point} of the linear series $\cD$ if $(\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_r) \neq (0,\dots,0)$---equivalently, if $\alpha_r > 0$---and we define the \emph{weight} of $p$ to be
$$
w(\cD, p) = \sum_{i=0}^r \alpha_i(\cD, p).
$$

If $\cD$ is very ample, so that it may be viewed at the linear series cut on $C$ by hyperplanes for some embedding $C \subset \PP^r$, then this coincides with the notion above: $p$ is an inflection point if $a_r > r$; that is, if there is a hyperplane $H \subset \PP^r$ having contact of order $r+1$ or more with $C$ at $p$.

The first two terms in the ramification sequence are particularly important: $\alpha_0(\cD, p)$ is nonzero if and only if $p$ is a base point of $\cD$; and if $\alpha_0(\cD, p)=0$, then $\alpha_1(\cD, p) = 0$ if and only if, in addition, the map $\phi_\cD$ is an immersion (that is, has nonzero derivative) at $p$.


\subsection{The Pl\"ucker formula}

Because A linear series on a smooth projective curve can have only finitely many inflection points (we will prove this in Lemma~\ref{finite inflections} below), and in fact the sum of the weights of all the inflection points depends only on the genus of the curve and the degree and dimension of the the linear series. The result is called the Pl\"ucker xormula:

\begin{theorem}\label{Plucker}
If $C \subset \PP^r$ is a nondegenerate smooth curve of genus $g$ and $\cD$ is a
linear series of degree $d$ and dimension $r$, then
 \begin{equation}\label{Plucker formula}
\sum_{p \in C} w(\cD, p) \; = \; (r+1)d + r(r+1)(g-1).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
For a proof, see for example~\cite[Theorem 7.13]{allthat}.

Theorem~\ref{Plucker} also holds in positive characteristic under the hypothesis that the number of inflection points is finite (equivalently, not every point is an inflection point). This may seem like an unnecessary hypothesis---it's hard even to imagine a plane curve in which every point is a flex!---but in positive characteristic there are such curves; see Exercise~\ref{inseparable Gauss} .
As an immediate consequence of the Pl\"ucker formula, we have

\begin{corollary}\label{uninflected curves}
 If $C\subset \PP^r$ is a smooth nondegenerate curve with no inflection points, then $C$ is the rational normal curve of degree $r$. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Suppose $C \subset \PP^r$ is a curve of degree $d$ and genus $g$. If $C$ has no inflection points then, by the Pl\"ucker formula, we must have
$$
(r+1)d + r(r+1)(g-1) = 0.
$$
This immediately implies that $g=0$, so that we must have $(r+1)(d-r) = 0$ and hence $d=r$; thus $C$ is a rational normal curve.
\end{proof}

In Proposition~\ref{independence on rnc} we showed that if $C \subset \PP^r$ is a rational normal curve, and $\Gamma \subset C$ any proper subscheme of $C$ of degree $r+1$, then $\Gamma$ spans $\PP^r$. The Corollary above implies that the
rational normal curves are the only ones with this property:
But if $C \subset \PP^r$ is any smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curve other than the rational normal curve,
 and $p \in C$ is an inflection point, then $(r+1)p$ is  a subscheme that lies in a hyperplane. 

Recall that $C\subset \PP^r$ is \emph{projectively homogeneous} if the automorphisms of $\PP^r$ fixing
$C$ act transitively on $C$.  Proposition~\ref{Veronese is projectively homogeneous} shows that the rational normal curve has this property, and now we can see that it's the only irreducible, nondegenerate curve that does: if $C \subset \PP^r$ is any curve and $\phi : \PP^r \to \PP^r$ any automorphism carrying $C$ to itself, $\phi$ will carry inflection points of $C$ to inflection points of $C$, so that a curve with a finite nonzero number of inflection points cannot be projectively homogeneous.

The Pl\"ucker formula leaves many questions about the possible configurations of flex points unanswered. To take the simplest:
no-one knows for which degrees $d$ there is a plane curve with the maximum number ${d-1\choose 2}$ of ordinary cusps (ramification
sequence $(0,1,1)$). \fix{Joe, can you refine this? Should we call it ``Zariski's problem''?} One thing we do know is the behavior of the inflection points for a general linear series; we will state this here and prove it as a corollary to the proof of the Brill-Noether theorem later in this chapter.

\begin{theorem}\label{Brill Noether Plucker}
If $C$ is a general curve of genus $g$, $L \in W^r_d(C) \subset \pic_d(C)$ a general line bundle of degree $d$ with $h^0(L) = r+1$ and $V = H^0(L)$, then every inflection point of the linear series $\cD = (L, V)$ has weight 1 and hence ramification sequence $(0, \dots, 0, 1)$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Flexes of plane curves}\label{plane curve pluecker}

Specializing Theorem~\ref{Plucker} to a curve of degree $d$ in the plane, and using the formula
$g= {d-1\choose 2}$, we see that the total number of flexes is $3(d-2)d$. 

It turns out that the ``flex divisor''
$\sum_{p\in C} w(C, p)p$
is the intersection of $C$ with a curve of degree $3(d-2)$, called the \emph{Hessian}: If $C$ is defined by a form $F(x_0, x_1, x_2)$ of degree $d$, then
the Hessian of $C$ is the curve defined by the determinant of the \emph{Hessian matrix} of partial derivatives
$$
Hess(C) :=
\begin{pmatrix}
 \partial^2 F/\partial x_0 \partial x_0 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_0 \partial x_1 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_0 \partial x_2 \\
\partial^2 F/\partial x_1 \partial x_0 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_1 \partial x_1 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_1 \partial x_2 \\
\partial^2 F/\partial x_2 \partial x_0 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_2 \partial x_1 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_2 \partial x_2 
\end{pmatrix}
$$
\begin{theorem}\label{Hessian} If $C$ is a smooth plane curve then the flex divisor of $C$ is the intersection 
of $C$ with the Hessian curve defined by $\det Hess(C)$.
\end{theorem}
The proof is an exercise in Euler's formula and matrix manipulation; see Exercise~\ref{Hessian exercise}.

\subsection{Weierstrass points}

As with any extrinsic invariant of a curve in projective space, we can derive an intrinsic invariant of an abstract curve by applying the invariant to the canonical linear series. We define a \emph{Weierstrass point} of a curve $C$ to be an inflection point of the canonical linear series $|K_C|$. 

Thus $p$ is a Weierstrass point of $C$ if there exists a  differential form on $C$ vanishing to order $g$ or more at $p$. The \emph{weight} $w_p$ of a Weierstrass point $p \in C$  is defined to be the weight $w(|K_C|,p)$ of $p$ as an inflection point of the canonical series. 

The Pl\"ucker formula tells us  the total weight of the Weierstrass points on a given curve $C$:

\begin{corollary}\label{plucker formula}
The sum of the weights of the Weierstrass points on a curve $C$ of genus $g$ is
$$
\sum_{p \in C} w_p = g^3-g.
$$\qed
\end{corollary}

Note that Theorem~\ref{Brill Noether Plucker} implies that on a general curve $C$ of genus $g$, every Weierstrass point has weight 1; thus there are $g^3-g$ distinct Weierstrass points on $C$

%Since there are only finitely many ramification points of the canonical series, a general point $p$ on any curve $C$ has gap sequence $(1,2,\dots,g)$, and correspondingly its Weierstrass semigroup
%is $W_p = (0, g+1, g+2, \dots)$. A Weierstrass point is called \emph{normal} if it has weight 1; this is tantamount to saying that the gap sequence is $(1,2,\dots,g-1,g+1)$, or that the semigroup is $(0, g, g+2, g+3, \dots)$. (The full Brill-Noether theorem tells us that a general curve $C$ has only normal Weierstrass points; this will be a consequence of Theorem~\ref{BN with inflection and dimension} below.)

For example, suppose $C$ is a curve of genus 2. The canonical series on $C$ gives a map $\phi_K : C \to \PP^1$ of degree 2; the Weierstrass points of $C$ are the 6 ramification points of this map. 

In genus 3, if $C$ is hyperelliptic then the Weierstrass points are exactly the 8 ramification points of the 2-sheeted cover $C \to \PP^1$, and each has weight 3. If $C$ is non-hyperelliptic, then it is a plane quartic curve. A general such curve will have 24 ordinary flexes, which will be Weierstrass points of weight 1; special quartics may have some number $\alpha$ of \emph{hyperflexes}---points where the tangent line has contact of order 4 with the curve---which will be Weierstrass points of weight 2; in this case $C$ will have $\alpha$ Weierstrass points of weight 2 and $24-2\alpha$ Weierstrass points of weight 1. (It has been shown that $\alpha$ cannot be 11, but  all  other values  between 0 and 12 occur. \fix{need citation})

\subsubsection{The Weierstrass semigroup} 

The Riemann-Roch formula tells us that
$$
h^0(\cO_C(gp)) = g - g + 1 + h^0(K_C(-gp))
$$
so the condition $h^0(K_C(-gp)) \neq 0$ that $p$ be a Weierstrass point is equivalent to the condition $h^0(\cO_C(gp)) > 1$; in other words, there exists a nonconstant rational function on $C$, regular on $C \setminus \{p\}$ and having a pole of order at most $g$ at $p$.

This suggests that we look at the set of all possible orders of pole at $p$ of rational functions regular on $C \setminus \{p\}$; that is,
$$
W(C,p) := \left\{ -\ord_p(f) \mid f \in K(C) \text{ with $f$ regular on } C \setminus \{p\} \right\}.
$$
This is clearly a sub-semigroup of the natural numbers $\NN$; it is called the \emph{Weierstrass semigroup} of the point $p$.  

Another way to characterize the condition that there exists a rational function on $C$, regular on $C \setminus \{p\}$, with a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$ is to say that
$$
h^0(\cO_C(kp)) = h^0(\cO_C((k-1)p)) + 1.
$$
Applying Riemann-Roch to both sides of this equation, we see that it is equivalent to the condition
$$
h^0(K_C(-kp)) = h^0(K_C((-k+1)p)).
$$

In English: there exists a rational function on $C$, regular on $C \setminus \{p\}$, with a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$, if and only if there does \emph{not} exist a regular differential on $C$ with a zero of order exactly $k-1$ at $p$.
 In other words, the complement $\NN \setminus W(C,p)$ is exactly the vanishing sequence of the canonical series at $p$, shifted by 1; in particular, it has cardinality  exactly $g$. This is called the \emph{Weierstrass gap sequence} of the point $p$.

There is still much we don't know about Weierstrass points in general. Most notably, we don't know what semigroups of finite index in $\NN$ occur as Weierstrass semigroups; an example of Buchweitz shows that not all semigroups occur, but there are also positive results, such as the statement ([EH]) that every semigroup of weight $w \leq g/2$ occurs, and its refinement and strengthening in~\cite{MR3892968}).


\section{Flexes and bitangents are isolated}\label{isolated flexes and bitangents}

There are two results concerning the inflectionary behavior of a curve in projective space that we needed for the proof of the uniform position lemma in Chapter~\ref{uniform position}; we will prove them here.

\subsection{Not every tangent line is a flex}\label{isolated tangents and bitangents}

\begin{lemma}\label{finite inflections}
If $r>1$ and $C \subset \PP^r$ is a smooth, irreducible and nondegenerate curve, then not every point of $C$ is an inflectionary point.
More generally, if $0\in D\rTo^v \PP^{r}$ is the germ of a curve defined on a disk $D\subset \CC$, and every point $v(t)$ is a flex point, then $v(D)$ lies in a hyperplane.
\end{lemma}

The proof applies to any linear series on a curve.

\begin{proof}
We begin by lifting $v(t)$ to an arc $\tilde v (t)$ in $\CC^{r+1}$, so that the tangent line at $v(0)$ in projective space
is represented by the span of $\tilde v(0), \tilde v'(0) \in \CC^{r+1}$. To say that $v(t)$ is an inflection point is to say that the 
$r+1$ vectors $\tilde v, \tilde v(t), \tilde v'(t), \dots,\tilde v^{(r)}(t)$ lie in a hyperplane $\tilde \Lambda \subset \CC^{r+1}$. If this holds for all $t \in D$ then
$$
\tilde v(t) \wedge \tilde v'(t) \wedge \dots \wedge \tilde v^{(r)}(t) \; \equiv \; 0.
$$
%fix{I suppressed the minimal plane spanned -- seemed not to matter.
%Now let $k$ be the smallest integer such that
%$$
%\tilde v(t) \wedge \tilde v'(t) \wedge \dots \wedge \tilde v^{(k)}(t) \; \equiv \; 0,
%$$
%so that the vectors $\tilde v(t), \tilde v'(t), \dots, \tilde v^{(k-1)}(t)$ span a $k$-plane $\Lambda \subset \CC^{r+1}$, and $\tilde v^{(k)}(t) \in \Lambda$.

When we take the derivative of the wedge product $\tilde v(t) \wedge \tilde v'(t) \wedge \dots \wedge \tilde v^{(r)}(t)$ by applying the product rule we see that the first $r$ terms are zero because they contain a repeated factor; it follows that
$$
\tilde v(t) \wedge \tilde v'(t) \wedge \dots \wedge \tilde v^{(k-1)}(t)\wedge \tilde v^{(r+1)}(t) \equiv 0,
$$
so that $\tilde v^{(r+1)}(t) \in \Lambda$ as well. Indeed, as we continue to take derivatives, we see in each case that all but one term is zero, and we deduce that $\tilde v^{(l)}(p) \in \Lambda$ for all $l$. Thus $v(D)$  lies in the hyperplane in $\PP^r$ corresponding
to $\Lambda$.
\end{proof}

 \subsection{Not every tangent is bitangent}
 
 This statement seems even more obvious than Lemma~\ref{finite inflections} above, but---like that lemma---is false in characteristic $p$! \fix{put an example in the exercises?}
 
 \begin{lemma}\label{tangent not bitangent}
 Let $C \subset \PP^r$ be a smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curve, with $r > 1$. If $p \in C$ is a general point, then the tangent line $\TT_p(C) \subset \PP^r$ is not tangent to $C$ at any other point.
 \end{lemma}
 
 \begin{proof} Again the result is local, this time with a pair of germs $D\rTo^v \PP^r$ and $D\rTo^w \PP^r$. If every
 tangent line to the two curves is a bitangent, we will show that they are both contained in a line.
 
  Let $C_1, C_2$ be the images of $v,w$ respectively, and let $\tilde v, \tilde w$ be lifts to $\CC^{r+1}$.
 Let  
 $$
 \Sigma := \{ (p,q) \in D \times D \mid \text{ and }\TT_{v(p)}(C_1) = \TT_{w(q)}(C_2) \}
 $$
 be the variety parametrizing bitangents to the two germs. 
 
 
 %Since $\Sigma$ cannot contain an open subset of a fiber, a local coordinate $t$ on $\Sigma$ at the point $(p,q)$ will serve as a local coordinate on $C$ at both $p$ and $q$; that is, we can write neighborhoods of $p$ and $q \in C$ parametrically via vector-valued functions $v(t)$ and $w(t) \in \CC^{r+1}$. 
 
 The statement that the tangent lines to $C$ at the points $v(t)$ and $w(t)$ are equal then says that the vectors $\tilde v(t), \tilde v'(t),\tilde w(t)$ and $\tilde w'(t)$ all lie in a 2-dimensional subspace $\Lambda \subset \CC^{r+1}$; in particular,
 $$
 \tilde v(t) \wedge \tilde v'(t) \wedge \tilde w(t) \equiv 0 \quad \text{and likewise} \quad \tilde v(t) \wedge \tilde w(t) \wedge \tilde w'(t) \equiv 0
 $$
 
We proceed now exactly as in the proof of Lemma~\ref{finite inflections}: taking derivatives, we see that all derivatives of $\tilde v(t)$
and $\tilde w$ at $t=0$ lie in $\Lambda$
and hence $C_1$ and $C_1$ are both contained in the line in $\PP^r$ corresponding to $\Lambda$.
 \end{proof}

Note: it's much less clear whether it can be the case that a general tangent line to $C$ can intersect $C$ in a point other than $p$, except of course in case $r=2$. %See~\cite{} for results on this question.
%\fix{Joe will write to Noam to ask for a reference.}

\section{Finiteness of the automorphism group}\label{finiteness section}


\begin{theorem}\label{finite autos}
If $C$ is a smooth curve of genus $\geq 2$ then the automorphism group $\Aut(C)$ is finite.
\end{theorem}

  The idea behind the argument is simple: because the Weierstrass points of a curve are intrinsically defined, any automorphism must carry Weierstrass points to Weierstrass points. We will show that the subgroup of $Aut(C)$ of automorphisms that fix each  of the finitely many Weierstrass point is either
 trivial or, in the case of hyperelliptic curves, just the $\ZZ/2$ generated by the hyperelliptic involution.
    
We will study the fixed points of automorphisms by studying the intersection of the graph of
an automorphism with the diagonal divisor in $C\times C$. For this we use
\emph{Neron-Severi group} $N(S)$ of a surface $S$. This consists of divisors modulo \emph{numerical equivalence}---that is, in $N(S)$ we identify divisors $H, H'$ if for all divisors $D$ on $S$ we have $H\cdot D = H'\cdot D$. The group
$N(S)$ is a  finitely generated free abelian group for any surface---in characteristic 0 it is a subgroup of the quotient of the second integral homology group by its torsion elements. The rank of $N(S)$ is called the \emph{Picard number} of $S$. 

\begin{theorem}[Hodge Index theorem]\label{hodge index}
If $H\subset S$ is an ample divisor on a smooth projective surface, and $D \neq 0 \in N(S)$ is a divisor class with $D\cdot H = 0$, then 
$D^2<0$; that is, the intersection pairing is negative definite on the orthogonal complement of an
ample divisor.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The result follows easily from the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces; see \cite[Theorem V.1.9]{Hartshorne1977}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{finite autos}]
 
The following two lemmas prove Theorem~\ref{finite autos} in a strong form:

\begin{lemma}Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and $f: C \to C$ an automorphism of $C$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $f$ has $2g+3$ or more distinct fixed points, then $f$ is the identity; and
\item If $f$ has $2g+2$ distinct fixed points, then either $f$ is the identity or $C$ is hyperelliptic and $f$ is the hyperelliptic involution.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $S = C\times C$, and let $\Delta$ and $\Gamma \subset S$ be the diagonal and the graph of $f$ respectively, and let $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2 \subset S$ be fibers of the two projection maps. Let $\delta, \gamma, \varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ be the classes of these curves in  $N(S)$. The number of fixed points of $f$ (counted with multiplicities) is the intersection number  $b = \delta \cdot \gamma$.

We know all the other pairwise intersection numbers of these classes: the ones involving $\varphi_1$ or $\varphi_2$ are obvious. The normal bundle of the diagonal is the tangent bundle of $C$, so
$$
\delta^2 = 2 - 2g.
$$
Since the automorphism $id_C \times f : C\times C \to C \times C$ carries $\Delta$ to $\Gamma$, we see that $\gamma^2 = 2-2g$ as well.

We can now apply the index theorem for surfaces to deduce our inequality. To keep things relatively simple, let's introduce two new classes: set
$$
\delta' = \delta - \varphi_1 - \varphi_2 \quad \text{and} \quad \gamma' = \gamma - \varphi_1 - \varphi_2,
$$
so that $\delta'$ and $\gamma'$ are orthogonal to the class $\varphi_1 + \varphi_2$. Since $\varphi_1 + \varphi_2$ has positive self-intersection, the index theorem  tells us that the intersection pairing must be negative definite on the span $\langle \delta',\gamma' \rangle \subset N(S)$. In particular, the determinant of the intersection matrix
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
& $\delta'$ &  $\gamma'$  \\
\hline
$\delta'$ & $-2g$ & $b-2$ \\
\hline
$\gamma'$ & $b-2$ & $-2g$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
(where again $b = \gamma \cdot \delta$) is nonnegative, or equivalently, $b\leq 2g+2$.
\end{proof}

Having established an upper  bound on the number of fixed points an automorphism $f$ of $C$ (other than the identity) may have, it remains to find a lower bound on the number of distinct Weierstrass points; this is the content of the next lemma.


\begin{lemma}
If $C$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g \geq 2$, then $C$ has at least $2g+2$ distinct Weierstrass points; and if it has exactly $2g+2$ Weierstrass points it is hyperelliptic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $p \in C$ be any point, and $w_1=w_1(p),\dots,w_g = w_g(p)$ the ramification sequence of the canonical series $|K_C|$ at $p$. By definition, 
$$
h^0(K_C(-(w_i+i)p)) = g - i.
$$
Applying Clifford's theorem we have
$$
g-i \leq \frac{2g - 2 - w_i - i}{2} + 1;
$$
solving, we see that
$$
w_i \leq i
$$
and hence
$$
w_p \leq \binom{g}{2}
$$
where $w_p$ is the total weight of $p$ as a Weierstrass point. Since the total weight of the Weierstrass points on $C$ is $g^3-g$ by the Pl\"ucker formula~\ref{***}, we see that the number of distinct Weierstrass points must be at least
$$
\frac{g^3-g}{\binom{g}{2}} = 2g+2.
$$
Finally, by the strong form of Clifford's Theorem \ref{***}, equality implies that the curve is hyperelliptic.\end{proof}


\end{proof}

\section{Inflections of linear series on $\PP^1$}

We are in a position to describe all possible inflectionary behavior of linear series on $\PP^1$. We will do this both because it's a natural question to ask, and because it will provide the essential ingredient in our proof of the Brill-Noether theorem in the next chapter.

If we embed $\PP^1$ in $\PP^d$ as a rational normal curve $C$, any $g^r_d$ on $\PP^1$ will be the linear system cut out on $C$ by hyperplanes containing a fixed $(d-r-1)$-plane $\Lambda$, and the inflectionary behavior of the $g^r_d$ is determined by how $\Lambda$ intersects the flag of \emph{osculating spaces}  to $C$ at a point, which we will define below. 

\subsection{Schubert cycles}

In this section we review the definition and a few facts about the subvarieties of the Grassmanian called Schubert cycles.
See for example~\cite[Chapters *** and ***]{3264} for a full exposition.

The set of planes $\Lambda \subset \PP^d$ meeting  the subspaces of a given flag in (at least) certain dimensions
is a subvariety of the Grassmannian called a Schubert cycle, and these will be central to our discussion.

Let $G = \GG(k, d)$ be the Grassmannian of $k$-planes $\PP^k \subset \PP^d$, or equivalently the Grassmannian $G(k+1,d+1)$ of $(k+1)$-dimensional subspaces of a $(d+1)$-dimensional vector space $V$.
To simplify the notation, we will write $\ell := k+1, e:= d+1$.
Our application, will use the projective setting, but for now it will be clearer to work in the context  of vector spaces.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{complete flag} $\cal V$  in an $e$-dimensional vector space $V$ is a nested sequence of vector spaces
$$
0 \subset V_1 \subset V_2 \subset \dots \subset V_d \subset V_{e} = V.
$$
with $\dim V_i = i$.
\end{definition}

Given a flag in $V$ and any  $\ell$-plane $\Lambda \subset V$, we can derive the nested sequence of $e$ subspaces of $\Lambda$:
$$
0 \; \subset \; \Lambda \cap V_1 \; \subset \;  \Lambda \cap V_2 \; \subset \;  \dots \; \subset \;  \Lambda \cap V_d \; \subset \;  \Lambda \cap V_{e} = \Lambda
$$
Each term in this sequence is either equal to the preceding one, or of dimension 1 greater; the former will occur $e-\ell$ times, and the latter $\ell$ times. For a general $\ell $-plane $\Lambda$, the jumps occur at the end; that is, we have $\Lambda \cap V_{e-\ell} = 0$, and thereafter the dimension of the intersection goes up by 1 each time. This makes it natural
to describe the special position of a given $\ell $-plane by how early the $i$-th jump occurs: 

\begin{definition}
A \emph{Schubert index} for $G(\ell, e)$ is a sequence ${\bf a} = (a_1,\dots,a_{\ell})$ of integers with $e-\ell \geq a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \dots \geq a_{\ell} \geq 0$.
The \emph{Schubert cycle $\Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V}) \subset G$} associated to a complete flat $\sV$ in $\CC^e$ and
Schubert index $\bf a$  is 
$$
\Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V}) \; := \; \left\{ \Lambda \in G \mid \dim(\Lambda \cap V_{e-\ell+i-a_i}) \geq i \; \forall i \right\}
$$
When $\cal V$ is clear from context (or immaterial) we sometimes drop it and write $\Sigma_{\bf a}$.
\end{definition}
Thus the variety  $\Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V})$ is the set of $\ell $-planes $\Lambda$ for which the $i$-th jump in the sequence of intersections $\Lambda \cap V_{e-\ell} = 0$ occurs
$a_i$ steps earlier than for the general $\ell $-plane. 

%Alternately, since a generic $\ell $-plane meets $V_s$ in dimension $\max\{0, \ell  - (d+1-s) = k-d+s\}$,  
%$\Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V})$ is the set of $\ell $-planes that meet $V_s$ in dimension $\geq k-d+s + a_

 
For example, the Schubert cycle $\Sigma_{0\dots,0}$ is the whole Grassmannian, 
and $\Sigma_{1,0\dots,0}(\cal V)$ is the set of $\ell$-planes that meet $V_{e-\ell}$ nontrivially, which is
the hyperplane section of the Grassmannian in its Pl\"ucker embedding.
If
${\bf a} = (t^m,0^{\ell-m}): = (t,\dots, t,0,\dots,0)$ with the number of $t$s equal to $m$, then
$\Sigma_{\bf a}(\cal V)$, is the set of $\ell $-planes that intersect $V_{e-\ell+i-t}$ in dimension $\geq i$ for all $i\leq m$ and are otherwise general. This condition is implied by the single condition $V\cap V_{e-\ell+m-t} \geq m$, and we will 
therefore write $\Sigma_{\bf a}(\cal V)$
as $\Sigma_m(V_{e-\ell+m-t})$. 

 The codimension $\sum a_i$ of $\Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V})$ in $G$ is $\sum_i a_i$ denoted $|{\bf a}|$ (Exercise~\ref{codim Schubert}).

The natural isomorphism $\phi$ between the Grassmannian $G(\ell, V)$ of $\ell$-planes in an $e$-dimensional vector space $V$, and the Grassmannian  $G(e-\ell, V^*)$ of $(e-\ell)$-planes in  the dual vector space $V^*$, sends a subspace $\Lambda \subset V$ to its annihilator in $V^*$. This isomorphism carries Schubert cycles in $G(\ell, V)$ defined relative to a flag $\cal V$ to Schubert cycles in $G(e-\ell, V^*)$ defined relative to the dual flag ${\cal V}^*$, but with different indices.

To describe the correspondence between Schubert indices,
suppose that ${\bf a} = (a_1,\dots, a_{\ell})$ is a Schubert index in $G(\ell, V)$, so that $n-k \geq a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \dots \geq a_{k+1} \geq 0$. The \emph{transpose} Schubert index to be the sequence ${\bf a}^*:  (b_1,\dots, b_{n-k})$ given by 
$$
 b_j \; := \; \#\{ i \mid a_i \geq j \}
$$
For the properties of this operation, see Exercise~\ref{Schubert duality}.


% $n-k \geq a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \dots \geq a_{k+1} \geq 0$
%
%or any Schubert index ${\bf a} = (a_1,\dots,a_{k+1})$ in $G(k+1, V)$, the Schubert cycle $\Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V})$ is carried into the Schubert cycle $\Sigma_{\bf b}({\cal V}^*)$, where $\bf b$ is what's called the \emph{transpose} Schubert index of $\bf a$; this can be defined by
%$$
%b_i = \#\{ j : a_j \geq i \}
%$$

\begin{fact}
The variety of complete flags in $\CC^e$ is rational, and it follows that the class of $\Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V})\subset G$
in the cohomology ring $H^*(G, \ZZ)$ of the Grassmanian $G = G(\ell, e)$ (or the Chow ring, which is the same in this case) is independent
of the flag $\sV$, and is typically denoted $\sigma_{\bf a}$. Moreover, the classes $\sigma_{\bf a}$ form a basis for the Chow ring of $G$. Thus the product $\sigma_{\bf a} \cdot \sigma_{\bf b}$ is a linear combination of Schubert classes,
given combinatorially by the \emph{Littlewood-Richardson formula}, the center of the \emph{Schubert calculus}, which
is the subject of a vast literature. We will explain an important special case of the Littlewood-Richardson formula called \emph{Pieri's formula} in Proposition~\ref{Pieri} below. For the general case, see for example~\cite{Vakil ****}.
\end{fact}


\subsection{Special Schubert cycles and Pieri's formula}

A \emph{special Schubert cycle} is a Schubert cycle of the form 
$$
\Sigma_{a, 0,\dots 0}({\cal V}) = \left\{ \Lambda \in G \mid \Lambda \cap V_{e-l+1-a} \neq 0 \right\}
$$

Pieri's formula is an explicit formula for the intersection product in the cohomology ring $H^*(G(\ell, e)$ of an arbitrary Schubert class with a special Schubert class:

\begin{fact}
\begin{proposition}\label{Pieri}
If $\sigma_a$ is a special Schubert class and $\sigma_{\bf b}$ is an arbitrary Schubert class, then
$$
\sigma_a \cdot \sigma_{\bf b} \; = \; \sum \sigma_{\bf c}
$$
where the sum ranges over all indices ${\bf c} = (c_1, \dots c_{k+1})$ with
$$
\sum c_i = a + \sum b_i \quad \text{and} \quad b_i \leq c_i \leq b_{i-1} \text{ for all } i
$$
\end{proposition}

For a proof, see for example \cite[****]{3264}.
\end{fact}
To understand what this is saying, imagine we represent the Schubert class $\sigma_{\bf b}$ by stacks of coins, with $b_1$ coins in the first stack, $b_2$ coins in the second stack, and so on. We now want to add a total of $a$ coins to the stacks; we can add any number of them to any stack (including a stack that was previously empty), with the one condition that the new height of each stack can't be larger than the previous height of the stack to its left. This interpretation makes the following corollary clear:

\begin{corollary}\label{intersection with sigma nonzero}
If $\sigma_a$ is any special Schubert class, $\sigma_{\bf b}$ is any Schubert class,
and $m\geq 0$ is an integer with $m a + \sum b_i \leq \dim G(\ell, e) = \ell(e-\ell)$, then   
$$
(\sigma_a)^l \cdot \sigma_{\bf b} \neq 0 \in H^*(G(\ell, e), \ZZ).
$$
\end{corollary}

This is all the Schubert calculus we will need for the applications we have in mind. For an account of basic Schubert calculus, see~\cite{3264}.

\subsection{Osculating flags}

We now want to relate the discussion above to inflection points of linear series on $\PP^1$.  To start with, let's introduce the notion of the \emph{osculating flag} to a curve at a point.

We'll do this first for a rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^d$. Here things are straightforward: for any point $p \in C$ and any $m \leq d+1$, we've seen that the span $\overline{mp}$ is an $(m-1)$-plane in $\PP^d$; thus we have a flag of linear subspaces
$$
\{p\} \subset \overline{2p} \subset \overline{3p} \subset \dots \subset \overline{dp} \subset \overline{(d+1)p} = \PP^d
$$
which we call the \emph{osculating flag} to $C$ at $p$. Note that the second term $\overline{2p}$ is the tangent line to $C$ at $p$; in general, the $k$-plane $\overline{(k+1)p}$ is called the \emph{osculating $k$-plane to $C$ at $p$}.

Though we will only be using this construction on rational normal curves, it's worth pointing out that we can define the osculating flag to any nondegenerate curve $C \subset \PP^d$ at any smooth point. Here it may no longer be the case that $\overline{mp}$ is an $(m-1)$-plane, but we can look at the nested sequence of subspaces
$$
\{p\} \subset \overline{2p} \subset \overline{3p} \subset \dots 
$$
and pick out exactly the terms whose dimension is strictly greater than the preceding one; we arrive in this way at the full flag
$$
\{p\} \subset \overline{b_2p} \subset \overline{b_3p} \subset \dots \subset \overline{b_{d+1}p} = \PP^d
$$
Note that if the point $p$ is not an inflectionary point, this is just the flag $\{\overline{mp}\}_{m=1}^d$; in general, we have the 

\begin{exercise}
Show that the sum $\sum b_i - i$ is equal to the weight of the point $p$ as an inflectionary point of the hyperplane series.
\end{exercise}

Let's now see what all this says about inflectionary behavior of $g^r_d$s on $\PP^1$. To set this up, first embed $\PP^1$ in $\PP^d$ as a rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^d$. For any $(d-r-1)$-plane $\Lambda \subset \PP^d$, let $V_\Lambda$ be the linear series cut on $C$ by hyperplanes in $\PP^d$ containing $\Lambda$. (Note that if $\Lambda \cap C \neq \emptyset$, the linear series $V_\Lambda$ will have base points; we do not throw those away, since we want $V_\Lambda$ to always be a $g^r_d$.) All $g^r_d$s on $\PP^1$ are given in this way.

Now let $p \in C$ be any point, and let $\cal V$ be the osculating flag to $C$ at $p$. It is reasonable to expect that the ramification sequence of the linear series $V_\Lambda$ at $p$ is related to whether $\Lambda$ lies in a Schubert cycles relative to the osculating flag to $C$ at $p$, and indeed the relationship is simple:

\begin{proposition}\label{ramification}
Let ${\bf a}$ be a Schubert index in the Grassmannian $G(d-r, d+1)$; that is ${\bf a} = (a_1, \dots a_{d-r})$ with $r+1 \geq a_1 \geq \dots \geq a_{d-r} \geq 0$, and let ${\bf a}^*$ be the transpose Schubert index. If $\cal V$ is the osculating flag to the rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^d$ at a point $p$,
then for any $(d-r-1)$-plane $\Lambda \subset \PP^d$, 
$$
\Lambda \in \Sigma_{\bf a}({\cal V}) \; \iff \; \alpha_i(V_\Lambda, p) \geq {\bf a}^*_{r+1-i}.
$$
\end{proposition} 

In other words, the ramification sequence $\alpha(V_\Lambda, p)$ of the linear series $V_\Lambda$ at $p$ is exactly the transpose of the Schubert index of the smallest Schubert cycle containing $\Lambda \in G(d-r, d+1)$, in reverse order.

\subsection{Conclusions}

The assertions made in the last section may seem like elementary restatements of obvious facts. But when we combine them with the Pl\"ucker formula, we can derive some fairly striking results, both about the existence (or non-existence) of linear series with specified ramification, and about the transversality of intersection of Schubert cycles in the Grassmannian.

The first theorem is a direct consequence of the Pl\"ucker formula:

\begin{theorem}\label{osculating intersection}
Let $p_1,\dots,p_\delta \in C$ be any points on a rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^d$, and ${\cal V}^1, \dots, {\cal V}^\delta$ the corresponding osculating flags. If ${\bf a}^1, \dots, {\bf a}^\delta$ are any $\delta$ Schubert indices, the Schubert cycles $\Sigma_{{\bf a}^1}({\cal V}^1), \dots, \Sigma_{{\bf a}^\delta}({\cal V}^\delta) \subset G(d-r, d+1)$ intersect properly.
\end{theorem}

Note that this does not depend on the choice of points $p_i$!

\begin{proof}
We start with the case
$$
\sum_{i=1}^\delta |{\bf a}^i| \; > \; (r+1)(d-r) = \dim G(d-r, d+1);
$$
in this case we have to show the intersection of the Schubert cycles $\Sigma_{{\bf a}^i}({\cal V}^i)$ is empty. But now suppose we had a $(d-r-1)$-plane 
$$
\Lambda \; \in \; \bigcap_{i=1}^\delta \Sigma_{{\bf a}^i}({\cal V}^i),
$$
and consider the linear series $V_\Lambda$ cut by hyperplanes containing $\Lambda$. By Proposition~\ref{ramification}, the weight of $p_i$ as an inflectionary point of $V_\Lambda$ is at least $|{\bf a}^i|$, so that the sum of the weights of the points $p_1,\dots,p_\delta$ is strictly greater than $(r+1)(d-r)$ by hypothesis. But the Pl\"ucker formula says that the sum of the weights of $V_\Lambda$ at \emph{all} inflectionary points of $C$ is equal to  $(r+1)(d-r)$, so we have a contradiction.

Next, we can deduce the general case from the above. To do this, we make use of the fact that the Schubert cycle $\Sigma_1$ is a hyperplane section of the Grassmannian $G(d-r, r+1)$, so that if $\Phi \subset G$ is any subvariety of dimension $m$, its intersection with $m$ Schubert cycles $\Sigma_1$ is nonempty. Thus, if the intersection
$$
\bigcap_{i=1}^\delta \Sigma_{{\bf a}^i}({\cal V}^i)
$$
had dimension strictly bigger than the expected
$$
\rho \; := \; (r+1)(d-r) - \sum_{i=1}^\delta |{\bf a}^i|,
$$
we could simply choose $\rho + 1$ additional points $q_1,\dots,q_{\rho + 1}$ on $C$, with osculating flags ${\cal W}^1, \dots, {\cal W}^{\rho + 1}$ and throw in the Schubert cycles $\Sigma_1({\cal W}^i)$. We would then have a nonempty intersection of Schubert cycles defined relative to osculating flags to $C$ and having total codimension strictly greater than $(r+1)(d-r)$, contradicting the first part.
\end{proof}

We will use this to prove a sort of converse, asserting the existence of linear series on $\PP^1$ with specified ramification, but first we want to mention one consequence of Theorem~\ref{osculating intersection}. First, a definition: given a curve $C \subset \PP^d$, we say that a \emph{secant flag} in $\PP^d$ is a flag
$$
0 \subset V_1 \subset V_2 \subset \dots \subset V_{d-1} \subset V_d = \PP^d
$$
where each $V_i$ is spanned by its (scheme-theoretic) intersection with $C$. In other words, there is a sequence of points $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{d+1} \in C$ such that
$$
V_i \; = \; \overline{p_1+p_2+ \dots + p_{i+1}}
$$
(An osculating flag is just the special case where all $p_i$ are equal.) Since any secant flag can specialize to an osculating flag, we can deduce the

\begin{corollary}\label{secant schubert proper}
Schubert cycles defined relative to \emph{general} secant flags to a rational normal curve intersect properly.
\end{corollary} 

\begin{exercise}
Show by example that Schubert cycles defined relative to arbitrary secant flags to a rational normal curve may fail to intersect properly. (Hint: it's enough to look at the case $d=2$ and $r=1$.)
\end{exercise}

Finally, we can use all of the above to answer the question of existence of $g^r_d$s on $\PP^1$ with specified ramification. To state it, suppose we are given a collection of distinct points $p_1,\dots,p_\delta \in \PP^1$, and for each point $p_i$ a possible ramification sequence
$$
\alpha^i = (\alpha^i_0, \alpha^i_1, \dots, \alpha^i_r) \quad \text{with} \quad 0 \leq \alpha^i_0 \leq \alpha^i_1 \leq \dots \leq \alpha^i_r \leq d-r.
$$
Let ${\bf a}^i$ be this sequence in reverse (and relabelled); that is
$$
{\bf a}^i \; = \; (\alpha^i_r, \alpha^i_{r-1}, \dots, \alpha^i_1, \alpha^i_0)
$$
and finally let ${\bf b}^i$ be the transpose of the Schubert index ${\bf a}^i$. We have then the

\begin{theorem}
There exists a $g^r_d$ on $\PP^1$ with ramification sequence at $p_i$ equal to $(\alpha^i_0, \alpha^i_1, \dots, \alpha^i_r)$ if and only if 
$$
\prod_{i=0}^\delta  \sigma_{{\bf b}^i} \; \neq \; 0 \quad \text{in} \quad A^*(G(d-r, r+1)).
$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Our arguments so far show the existence of a $g^r_d$ on $\PP^1$ with ramification sequence greater than or equal to $\alpha^i$ at $p_i$. But by Theorem~\ref{osculating intersection}, the ones with ramification strictly greater than $\alpha^i$ form a family of strictly smaller dimension. Thus a general $g^r_d$ with ramification sequence greater than or equal to $\alpha^i$ at $p_i$ will have  ramification sequence exactly equal to $\alpha^i$ at $p_i$
\end{proof}

\section{Exercises}
\begin{exercise}\label{inseparable Gauss}
Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Show that every point of the affine curve $y = x^{p+1}+1$ over $k$ is a flex point.
 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{Hessian exercise} 
Let $p\in C$ be a smooth point of a  plane curve with equation $F(x_0,x_1,x_2) = 0$ of degree $d>1$. Show that the tangent line to $C$ at $p$ meets
$C$ is a scheme of order $m+2$ if and only if the determinant of the Hessian matrix vanishes
along $C$ to order $m$ as is done in \cite[pp. 84--85]{Kunz}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume that $p = (0,0)\in \AA^2\subset \PP^2$, where $\AA^2$ is the locus $x_0\neq 0$, 
and suppose that $f(x,y) =0$ is the affine equation of $C$, with $x= x_1/x_0, y = x_2/x_0$.
Reduce to the affine case by showing that
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\det Hess(C) = \\
&x_0^2 \det 
\begin{pmatrix}
 d(d-1)F & (d-1) \partial F/\partial x_1 & (d-1) \partial F/\partial x_2 \\
 (d-1) \partial F/\partial x_1&\partial^2 F/\partial x_1 \partial x_1 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_1 \partial x_2\\
 (d-1) \partial F/\partial x_2 &\partial^2 F/\partial x_2 \partial x_1 & \partial^2 F/\partial x_2 \partial x_2 
\end{pmatrix} .
\end{aligned}
$$ 
Writing the partial derivatives as subscripts, this becomes
$$
\det \begin{pmatrix}
 d(d-1)f & (d-1) f_x & (d-1) f_y \\
 (d-1) f_x&f_{xx} & f_{xy}\\
 (d-1) f_y &f_{xy} & f_{yy}
\end{pmatrix}
$$ 
when restricted to $\AA^2$.

\item Assume that the tangent line to $C$ at $p$ is $y=0$. Show that $f$ can be written as
$$
f = x^{m+2}\phi(x) +y\psi(x,y)
$$
where $\phi(0) \neq 0$ and $\psi(0,0) \neq 0$, and thus, modulo $f$, the Hessian determinant,
up to a constant factor, 
has the form
$$
f_x^2f_{yy}+f_y^2f_{xx}-2f_xf_yf_{xy}.
$$
Note that $x$ is a local parameter at $p$. Using the form of $f$ above, show that there is a unique term vanishing to order $m$ at $p$,
and no term vanishing to lower order there.
\item
\end{enumerate}
