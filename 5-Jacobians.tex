\chapter{Jacobians}\label{Jacobians chapter}\label{new Jacobians chapter}\label{JacobianChapter}

We have seen that the points of an elliptic curve naturally form an algebraic group. This is not true for curves of higher genus, but there is a substitute: the Jacobian.
An essential construction in studying a curve $C$ is the association of an invertible sheaf to a divisor\emdash in other words, the map
$$
\big\{ \text{effective divisors of degree $d$ on $C$}\big\} \ruto{\ \mu} \big\{ \text{invertible sheaves of degree $d$ on $C$} \big\}
$$
sending $D$ to $\cO_C(D)$.

A priori, this is a map of sets. But it is a fundamental fact that
both source and target
may  be given the structure of an algebraic variety in a natural way,
and that in terms of this structure the map between them is a
morphism. In many ways the geometry of the map governs the geometry of
the curve.
In this chapter we will describe the source and target of $\mu$, and give references to proofs of their properties.

We start with the effective divisors. Since $C$ is smooth, an
\index{effective divisor}%
\index{invertible sheaf}%
effective divisor of degree $d$ on $C$ is the same thing as a
subscheme $D \subset C$ of dimension 0 and degree $d$, and thus
the family $C_d$ of effective divisors of degree $d$ on $C$ is a
Hilbert scheme; see Section~\ref{hilbert scheme section}. This Hilbert
\index{Hilbert scheme}%
scheme may be identified with
the $d$-th \emph{symmetric power} $C_d$  of $C$, described in Section~\ref{symmetric section}.
\index{symmetric power}%

The parametrization of the set of invertible sheaves on $C$ of a given
degree $d$ by the variety $\Pic_d(C)$, called the
\emph{Picard variety}
\index{Picard variety/scheme}%
of $C$, requires different techniques. We will define it by
a universal property in the category of schemes, and exhibit its
construction as an analytic variety, actually a complex torus
\index{notation!$\Jac(C)$}%
\index{notation!$\Pic_0(C)$}%
$\Jac(C)$, whose group structure reflects the tensor product of
sheaves in $\Pic_0(C)$.
Historically, the algebraic construction was a major milestone, first
\index{historical context}%
reached in the work of
Andr\'e
\index{Weil, Andr\'e}%
Weil in the middle of
the
twentieth
century, and then reshaped by Grothendieck and his school.
\index{Grothendieck, Alexander}%
The interested reader will find a beautiful, detailed account both of the history and the
modern theory of the scheme of divisors and the Picard scheme in
\cite{Kleiman-PicardScheme},
which has extensive references to the original literature.

A consequence of the modern theory is that we can extend the
\index{Picard variety/scheme}%
construction of the Picard variety to singular curves as well as smooth
ones. Also, given a family $\pi : \cC \to B$ of curves there is a
corresponding family of Picard varieties $\pic_d(\cC/B) \to B$, called
the
\emph{relative Picard variety,}
\index{Picard variety!relative}%
 whose
fiber over a closed point $b\in B$ is the Picard scheme $\pic_d(C_b)$
of the corresponding curve $C_b$ in our family.
In Chapter~\ref{Brill Noether proof chapter} we'll have occasion to
describe the Picard varieties of $g$-nodal and $g$-cuspidal curves, and
to see how these fit into families with Picard varieties of smooth curves.

As an application of the existence of the spaces $C_d$ and $\Pic_d$, we show in Section~\ref{g+3 section} that a general divisor of degree $g+3$ on any curve of genus $g$ gives rise to an embedding in $\PP^3$ as a curve of degree $g+3$, and there are related results for general divisors of degree $g+2$ and $g+1$.

\section{Symmetric products and the universal divisor}\label{symmetric section}

Let $C$ be a smooth curve. The space of effective divisors on $C$ can be characterized by a universal property:

\begin{definition}
Let $B$ be any scheme. A
\emph{family}
of effective divisors of degree
\index{family!of effective divisors}%
$d$ on $C$, parametrized by the scheme $B$, is a
Cartier divisor
\index{Cartier divisor}%
$X\subset B\times C$ whose intersections with fibers $\{b\} \times C
\cong C$ over points of $B$ are divisors of degree $d$ on $C$.
\end{definition}

Given this, we have a contravariant functor
$$
F : (\textrm{schemes}) \to (\textrm{sets}),
$$
taking a scheme $B$ to the set of families of divisors of degree $d$
on $C$ over $B$; if $\pi : B' \to B$ is any morphism, the induced map
$F(B) \to F(B')$ is defined by taking a family $\cD \subset B \times C$
to the fiber product $\cD' \colonequals  B' \times_B \cD \subset B' \times C$.
We say that a scheme $C_d$ is a
fine moduli space
\index{fine moduli space}%
\index{moduli space!fine}%
for divisors of degree $d$ on $C$ if there is an isomorphism of functors
$$
F \cong \Hom_{\mathrm{Schemes}}( -, C_d).
$$
By
Yoneda's lemma
\index{Yoneda's lemma}%
(Exercise~\ref{Yoneda}), this is equivalent to the
existence of a
\emph{universal family}
\index{universal family}%
$\cD \subset C_d \times C$,
with the property that for any family $X \subset B \times C$ of
divisors on $C$ over any scheme $B$, there is a unique map $\phi : B
\to C_d$ such that $X = (\phi \times id_{C})^{-1}(\cD)$.

From the universal property it is clear that a fine moduli space for
divisors of degree $d$ on $C$ is unique if it exists. Indeed, it does
exist, and we'll sketch the construction, using symmetric products.
This construction relies on the existence of
quotients of schemes
\index{quotient!schemes}%
by
finite groups, and we pause to discuss such quotients.

\subsection*{Finite group quotients}

If $G$ is a finite group acting by automorphisms on an affine scheme
\index{group action}%
\index{automorphism}%
\index{affine scheme!quotient}%
\index{spectrum}%
\index{invariance!under group action}%
\index{orbit}%
$X\colonequals\Spec A$ then $X/G$ is by definition $\Spec(A^G)$, the spectrum of
the ring $A^G$ of invariant elements of $A$. Since the functions in $A^{G}$
are constant on orbits, every fiber is a union of orbits, but something much better is true:

\begin{theorem}\label{finite invariant theory}
The map $\pi: X\to X/G$ induced by the inclusion of rings is finite.
\index{finite map}%
If $X$ is a normal variety, then each fiber of $\pi$  is a single orbit of $G$.
\end{theorem}

For a proof, see for example \cite[Proposition 13.10]{Eisenbud1995}.


Since the map $X\to X/G$ is finite, we have $\dim X/G = \dim X$.

The construction commutes with the passage to $G$-invariant open
\index{invariance!under group action}%
affine sets, and thus passes to
\index{quasiprojective scheme}%
quasiprojective schemes
as well
(Exercise~\ref{quotient of projective}), though not to arbitrary
schemes (see \cite[Example 5.3.2]{Olsson}).

When the group $G$ is positive-dimensional, the situation becomes much more complex, and is the subject
\index{geometric invariant theory}%
of
\emph{geometric invariant theory}
\emdash see Chapter~\ref{CurvesModuliChapter}
for some  idea of what can and cannot be done
in a special case.

If $X$ is any  quasiprojective scheme we define the
\emph{$d$-th symmetric power $X^{(d)}$ of\, $X$}
\index{symmetric power!of a quasiprojective scheme}%
to be the quotient of the Cartesian product $X^d$ of $d$ copies of $X$
by the action of the
symmetric group
\index{symmetric group}%
 of
permutations of the factors, and let $\pi_d: X^d\to\nobreak X^{(d)}$ be
the projection. There is a natural
subvariety
$$
\cD = \bigl\{(x,y) \in X^{(d)} \times X\mid \hbox{$y$ is in the projection of $\pi_d^{-1}(x)$ to the first factor}@\bigr\}@;
$$
in other words, if we think of a point $x \in X^{(d)}$ as an unordered $d$-tuple of points on $X$, the fiber of $\cD$ over $x$ is the collection of points in $x$.

If $X=\AA^{1}$ then $X^{d} = \AA^{d} = \Spec \CC[x_{1}, \dots,
x_{d}]$. The ring of
invariants of the symmetric group
\index{invariants!of the symmetric group}%
acting on
$\CC[x_{1}, \dots, x_{d}]$ by permuting the variables is generated by the $d$
\index{symmetric functions}%
elementary symmetric functions, which generate a polynomial subring, and $X^{(d)}$ is isomorphic to $\AA^{d}$. Since the symmetric functions of the roots of a polynomial in one variable are the coefficients of
that polynomial, we may identify $X^{(d)}$ with the affine space of
monic polynomials of degree $d$ in~$\CC[z]$.
(See \cite[Exercises 1.6, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4]{Eisenbud1995}.)

Next consider $X = \PP^1$ and the product $(\PP^1)^d` `$. Taking the homogeneous coordinates of the
$i$-th copy of $\PP^1$ to be $(s_i,t_i)$, the $d+1$ multilinear symmetric functions of degree $d$,
$$
t_1t_2\cdots t_d,\quad \sum_i s_it_1\cdots\hat t_i\cdots t_d,\ \quad \dots \quad\ s_1\cdots s_d
$$
are the coefficients of the polynomial
$$
(s_1a + t_1b)(s_2a + t_2b)\cdots(s_da + t_db)
$$
defining a general
subscheme
of $\PP^1$ of degree $d$. These forms  define
an isomorphism $(\PP^1)^{(d)} \to \PP^d` `$.
Again, we may think of this map as taking a $d$-tuple of points to the unique-up-to-scalars
homogeneous form of degree $d$ vanishing on it.
Identifying $(\PP^1)^{(d)}$ with the space of forms
$F$ of degree $d$, the fiber of the subscheme $\cD\subset \PP^1 \times \PP^d \to \PP^d$
over a form $F$ is the subscheme defined by $F$.

We shall see that when $C$ is a smooth curve of higher genus, the global geometry of $C^{(d)}$ is nontrivial, but at least the local geometry is simple:

\begin{proposition}
If $C$ is a smooth curve then each symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is smooth, and the subscheme
$\cD \subset C\times C^{(d)}$ is a family of divisors.
\unif
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
It suffices to
 show that the quotient of an invariant
formal neighborhood
of the preimage $\{p_1,\dots, p_s\}$ of a point
 $\bar p\in C^{(d)}$ in $C^d$  is smooth. After completing the local rings, we get an action of the symmetric group
 $G$ on the product of the completions of $X$ at the $p_i$, and this depends only on the orbit
 structure of $G$ acting on $\{p_1,\dots, p_s\}$. Thus it would be the same for some orbit of
 points on $\AA^1` `$, so the general case follows from the smoothness of $(\AA^{1})^{(d)}$.
\unif
 \end{proof}

By contrast, if $\dim X \geq 2$, the symmetric powers $X^{(d)}$ are
singular for all $d \geq \nobreak 2$.
See Exercise~\ref{sym2A2} for the case of $(\AA^2)^{(2)}$ and Exercise~\ref{free actions} for a well-behaved case.
\vspace{3pt}

\begin{fact}\label{universal property of symmetric power}
It is clear from Theorem~\ref{finite invariant theory} that the points
of $C^{(d)}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the effective
divisors of degree $d$ on $C$, but much more is true:
\smallbreak
{\it
If $C$ is a smooth projective curve, then the $d$-th
symmetric power
\index{symmetric power}%
$C^{(d)}$ of $C$ is the
fine moduli space
\index{fine moduli space}%
$C_d$ of effective divisors of degree $d$ on $C$ with
universal family
\index{universal family}%
\index{family!universal}%
$\cD\subset C\times C_d \to C_d$.
}
\smallbreak
For a proof in the analytic category, see \cite[p.\,164]{ACGH};
for the algebraic fact, see \cite[Remark 9.3.9]{Kleiman-PicardScheme}.
The result remains true for
families of curves,
\index{family of curves}%
 that is, smooth curves in
the category of schemes over a base scheme $B$.
\end{fact}

Henceforward we will write $C_d$ in place of $C^{(d)}$.

\section{The Picard varieties}\label{Picard section}

As with $C_d$, we may define $\Pic_d(C)$ by a universal property. We start by saying what we mean by a family of invertible sheaves on a smooth curve $C$:

\begin{definition}
For any scheme $B$, a \emph{family of invertible sheaves on $C$ over $B$}
\index{family!of invertible sheaves}%
is an equivalence class of invertible sheaves $\sL$ on $B\times C$,
where two such
 families $\sL$ and $\sL'$ are equivalent if they differ by an invertible sheaf pulled back along the projection $\pi_1: B\times C \to B$, that is, if
 $$
 \sL' \cong \sL \otimes \pi_1^*\cF
 $$
for some invertible sheaf $\cF$ on $B$.
The family $\sL$  is a \emph{family of invertible sheaves of degree $d$} if, moreover, the restriction of $\sL$
 to $\{b\}\times C$ has degree $d$ for each point $b\in B$.
 \end{definition}

If $p \in C$ and $\cF$ is a sheaf on $B$ then $\pi_1^*(\cF)\mid_{B\times p} = \cF$, so we could have eliminated the
equivalence relation at the expense of choosing a point by insisting that the restriction of $\sL$ to $B \times \{p\}$ be trivial.

We define the functor
\index{notation!$\Pic_d$}%
 $$
 \Pic_d : (\textrm{schemes}) \to (\textrm{sets})
 $$
by associating to any scheme $B$ the set of invertible sheaves of
degree $d$ on $B \times C$, modulo tensoring with pullbacks of
invertible sheaves on $B$. Since the tensor products and inverses of
invertible sheaves of degree 0 again
have
degree~0,
$\Pic_0$ factors through the category of abelian groups. These
functors too are representable by schemes:

\begin{fact}[{{{\cite[Theorem 9.4.8]{Kleiman-PicardScheme}}}}]
\label{picard existence1}
Kleiman's cited paper gives the proof (in a still more general setting) that if
$f:X\to S$ is projective over $S$ with reduced irreducible fibers, then
there exists a fine moduli space $\Pic_d(C)$ for invertible sheaves of
degree $d$ on $C$; that is, a scheme $\Pic_d(C)$ and an invertible
sheaf $\cP$ of degree $d$ on $\Pic_d(C) \times C$, such that for any
scheme $B$ there is, in the complex analytic category, a natural bijection between families of invertible
sheaves of degree $d$ over $B$, modulo invertible sheaves on $B$, and
morphisms $B \to \Pic_d(C)$, defined by pulling back $\cP$. The tensor
product of invertible sheaves makes $\Pic_0(C)$ an algebraic group,
which acts on each $\Pic_d(C)$. The sheaf $\cP$ is called a
\index{Poincar\'e sheaf}%
\emph{Poincar\'e sheaf} for $C$.

The choice of $\cP$ makes the variety $\Pic_0(C)$ into a
projective algebraic group
\index{projective algebraic group}%
\index{algebraic group!projective}%
with group law given by tensor product of
invertible sheaves of degree 0, and origin the point of $\Pic_0(C)$
that is the
 image of $\Spec \CC$ under the map corresponding to the structure sheaf of $C$ regarded
 as family of sheaves over $\Spec \CC$; and for each $d$, $\Pic_d(C)$
 is a
\index{principal homogeneous space}%
for $\Pic_0(C)$.

The construction works for families of curves as long as there is a section (the Poincar\'e sheaf on $\pic_d(C) \times C$ relies on the existence of a point on $C$, so that it does not apply to families of curves unless the family has a section). That is, given a family of curves $\sC \to S$ with a section $\sigma: S\to \sC$
 there is a scheme $\Pic_{d}(\sC/S) \to S$ that represents the functor of families of invertible sheaves of
 degree $d$ over $S$-schemes $B\to S$. We will use this important refinement in the proof of the Brill--Noether theorem given in Chapter~\ref{BrillNoetherproofChapter}.
  \end{fact}

If $\sL$ is any invertible sheaf of degree $e$ on $C$, we can define a
bijection between families of invertible sheaves of degree $d$ over
\index{family!of invertible sheaves}%
$B$ and families of invertible sheaves of degree $d+e$ over $B$,
uniformly for all $B$, by tensoring with the pullback $\pi_2^*\sL$.
Thus $\Pic_d(C) \cong \Pic_{d+e}(C)$ (but not canonically, since the
isomorphism depends on the choice of $\sL$).

The description of the functors represented by the symmetric product $C_d$ and the Picard scheme $\Pic_d$ implies that the
set-theoretic map
$$
C_d \to \Pic_d, \quad D \mapsto \sO_c(D),
$$
is the underlying set map of a morphism of schemes: on the level of functors the map takes a family of divisors $\cD\subset B\times C$
to the family of sheaves $\cO_{B\times C}(\cD)$.

The characterization of $\Pic_d(C)$
given
above does not shed much light on the geometry of $\Pic_d(C)$: whether
it's irreducible, for example, or what its dimension is. But we can
get a  good picture from the classical construction of the Jacobian,
$\Jac(C)$, which has roots in the nineteenth century.

\section{Jacobians}

The history leading to the analytic construction of the Jacobian
\index{Jacobian!analytic construction}%
starts from a
calculus
\index{calculus}%
\index{historical context}%
problem. A goal of the nineteeth century
mathematicians was  to make sense of
integrals of algebraic functions.
\index{integration}%
In the early development of calculus, mathematicians figured out how
to evaluate integrals such as
$$
\int_{t_0}^t \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}.
$$
From a modern point of view such integrals can be thought of as
path integrals
\index{path integral}%
of
meromorphic differentials
\index{meromorphic differential}%
on the
Riemann surface
\index{Riemann surface}%
associated to the equation $y^2 = x^2+1$. This surface is isomorphic
to $\PP^1` `$, meaning that $x$ and $y$ can be expressed as rational
functions of a single variable $z$; making the corresponding change of
variables transformed the integral into one of the form
$$
\int_{s_0}^s R(z)\,dz,
$$
with $R$ a rational function, and such integrals can be evaluated by the technique of partial fractions.

When they tried to extend this to similar-looking integrals, such as
$$
\int_{t_0}^t \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^3+1}},
$$
which arises when one studies the length of an arc of an ellipse, they
\index{elliptic integral}%
were stymied. The reason gradually emerged: the problem is that the
Riemann surface associated to the equation $y^2 = x^3+1$ is not
$\PP^1` `$, but rather a curve of genus 1, and so has nontrivial
homology group $H_1(C, \ZZ) \cong \ZZ^2` `$. In particular, if one
expresses this ``function'' of $t$  as a path integral, then the value
\vadjust{\goodbreak}%
depends on a choice of path; it is defined only modulo a lattice
$\ZZ^2 \subset \CC$ (Figure~\ref{a lattice}). This implies
that the inverse function is a doubly periodic
\index{meromorphic function}%
meromorphic function
on
$\CC$, and not an elementary function. Many new special functions,
%
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=1.15in,trim=0 40 0 12,clip]{"main/Fig04-2"}}
\vskip-6pt
\caption{An elliptic curve is the quotient of $\CC$ by a lattice $\ZZ\oplus \ZZ\tau$.}
\label{a lattice}
\index{lattice}%
\end{figure}
%
such as the
Weierstrass $\sP$-function,%
\index{Weierstrass $\sP$-function}%
\index{P@$\sP$-function}%
were studied as a result. The name
``elliptic curve''
\index{elliptic curve!naming}%
arose from these considerations.

\begin{figure}[b]
\vskip3pt
\includegraphics[height=0.9in]{"main/Fig04-1"}
\vskip-3pt
\caption{Two paths from $p$ to $q$ might give different values of a path integral.}
\label{dependence on path}
\end{figure}

Once this case was understood, the next step was to extend the theory
to
path integrals
\index{path integral}%
of
holomorphic differentials
\index{holomorphic differential}%
on curves of arbitrary
genus. One problem is that the dependence of the integral on the
choice of path is much worse
(Figure~\ref{dependence on path});
the set of homology classes of paths
between two points $p_0, p \in C$ is identified with $H_1(C,\ZZ) \cong
\ZZ^{2g}$ rather than $\ZZ^2` `$, rendering the expression $\int_p^q
\omega$ for a given 1-form $\omega$ virtually meaningless.
{\meshing\par}

To express the solution to this problems in relatively modern terms,
let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ over $\CC$, and let
$\omega_{C}$ be the sheaf of differential forms on $C$. We will
consider $C$ as a
complex manifold.
\index{complex manifold}%
\index{complex manifold|seealso Riemann surface}%
Every meromorphic differential form is in fact algebraic
\cite{SerreGAGA}, and we consider $\omega_{C}$ as a sheaf in the analytic topology.

Integration
\index{integration}%
over a closed loop in $C$ defines a linear function on 1-forms, so that we have a map
$$
\iota: \ZZ^{2g} = H_1(C,\ZZ) \; \to \;  H^0(\omega_C)^* \cong H^1(\sO_C) = \CC^{g}.
$$
By Hodge theory,
\index{Hodge theory}%
$$
H^1(C, \CC) \cong H^1(C, \cO_C) \oplus \overkern20{H^1(C, \cO_C)}
,
$$
where the bar denotes complex conjugation in $H^1(C, \CC)$, and the map $\iota$ is the composition of
 the natural inclusion with the projection to the first summand.
 Now
$H_1(C,\CC) = \CC\otimes_\ZZ H_1(C,\ZZ)$, so any basis of $H_1(C,\ZZ)$ maps to a basis of
$H^1(C, \CC)$ invariant under conjugation in $H^1(C, \CC)$\emdash
see \cite{Voisin} or \cite[p.\,116]{Griffiths-Harris1978}.

One can show that the image of $\iota$ is a
\index{lattice}%
lattice in $H^0(\omega_C)^*` `$, and thus the quotient
is a torus of real dimension $2g$.
Moreover, the
complex structure on $H^0(\omega_C)^*$ yields a complex analytic structure on the quotient $\CC^{g}/\iota(\ZZ^{2g})$, which is thus a complex torus of  dimension $g$.
\index{complex torus}%

\begin{definition}
\hskip-3pt
The complex torus $J(C) \,{\colonequals}\, \CC^{g}/\iota(\ZZ^{2g})$
\index{Jacobian}%
\index{notation!$J(C)$}%
is called the \emph{Jacobian} of~$C$.%
\unif
\end{definition}

The point of this construction is that for any pair of points $p, q
\in C$, the expression $\int_q^p$ describes a linear functional on
$H^0(\omega_C)$, defined up to functionals obtained by integration
over closed loops, and thus a point of $@J(C)$. We can think of $p-q$
as a divisor of
degree 0, and the map $p-q \mapsto \int_q^p$ extends to a well defined map $\mu_0$ from divisors of degree 0 to $J(C)$ because if $p',q'$ are two more points, then
{\meshing
$$
\int_q^p +\int_{q'}^{p'} \! - \,\biggl(@\int_q^{p'} +\int_{q'}^p@\biggr)
$$}%
is the integral around a closed path $q\to p\to q'\to p' \to q$.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=1.3in]{"main/Fig04-3"}
 \caption{The map $\mu$ maps a curve of genus 1 to the quotient of the plane by the lattice $\Lambda = \ZZ\langle 1,\tau\rangle$.}
\label{abeljacobi}
\end{figure}

Further, if we choose a basepoint  $p\in C$, we can define the holomorphic map (Figure \ref{abeljacobi})
\index{notation!mu!$\mu$, $\mu_d$}%
$$
\mu  :  C  \to  J(C), \quad q\mapsto \int_{p}^{q},
$$
and more generally maps
$$
\mu_d
:  C_d  \to  J(C), \quad (q_1,\dots, q_d) \mapsto \sum_i \int_{p}^{q_i}.
$$
These
are called the \emph{Abel--Jacobi} maps. When there is no
\index{Abel--Jacobi maps}%
ambiguity about $d$, we will denote all these maps  by $\mu$,  and
we extend the definition by defining $\mu(-D)$ to be $-\mu(D)$.
The map $\mu$ is a group homomorphism in the sense that if $D, E$ are divisors, then
$\mu (D+E) = \mu(D) + \mu(E)$; this is immediate when the divisors are effective, and
follows in general because the group of divisors is a free abelian group.

\section{Abel's theorem}

The connection between the discussion above and the geometry of linear
series is made by one of the landmark theorems of the nineteenth century:

\begin{theorem}[Abel's theorem]\label{abel}
Two effective divisors of degree $d$ on $C$  are linearly
\index{Abel's theorem}%
equivalent if and only if their images under the Abel--Jacobi map are
equal;
equivalently,
the fibers of $\mu_d$ are
the complete linear systems of degree $d$ on $C$. Thus $\mu_0$ factors
through a canonical isomorphism
$\Pic_0(C) \to J(C)$ and, after choosing a basepoint $p$, an
isomorphism $\Pic_d(C) \to \nobreak\Jac(C)$, factoring through the isomorphism
$$
\Pic_d(C) \ruuuto {-\otimes \sO_C(-dp)} \Pic_0(C) \to J(C).
$$
\end{theorem}

We will prove only one implication,
the part proved by Abel; the converse, which is substantially more subtle, was proved by Clebsch.
For a complete proof,
see \cite[Section 2.2]{Griffiths-Harris1978}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of ``only if'']
If $D$ and $D'$ are linearly equivalent, then they are the zero loci of
sections $\sigma, \sigma'$ of an invertible sheaf $\sL$.
Taking linear combinations of $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$, we get a pencil $\{D_\lambda\}_{\lambda \in \PP^1}$ of divisors on $C$, with
$$
D_\lambda  =  V(\lambda_0\sigma + \lambda_1\sigma'),
$$
and by the
universal property
\index{universal property}%
of the
symmetric product (Cheerful Fact~\ref{universal property of symmetric power})
\index{symmetric product!universal property}%
this
corresponds to a regular map $\alpha : \PP^1 \to C_d$.

Consider the composition
$$
\phi = \mu \circ \alpha  :  \PP^1  \to  J(C).
$$
 If $z$ is any linear functional on $V = H^0(\omega_C)^*$ then the differential $dz$  on $V$ descends to a global holomorphic 1-form on
 $J(C)$, since this is the quotient of $V$ by a discrete lattice. Thus
the regular one-forms on $J(C)$ generate the
cotangent space to $J(C)$
\index{cotangent!space to $J(C)$}%
at every point. But for any 1-form $\omega$ on $J(C)$, the pullback
$\phi^*\omega$ is a global holomorphic 1-form on $\PP^1` `$, and hence
identically zero. It follows that the differential $d\phi$ vanishes
identically, and hence that $\phi$ is constant, proving that $\mu(D)=\mu(D')$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{torsion points}
Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g$. The number of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves whose $n$-th power is $\sO_C$ is $n^{2g}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
 This is the number of

Andr\'e Weil applied Abel's theorem to
give an algebraic description of
the structure of the
\index{Weil, Andr\'e}%
Jacobian, using the following fact:
\index{Jacobi inversion theorem}%

\begin{corollary}[Jacobi inversion theorem]
\label{Jacobi inversion theorem}
If $C$ is a smooth curve of genus $g$ then the Abel--Jacobi map
$\mu_g: C_d \to J(C)$ is  surjective for $d\geq g$ and
generically injective for $d\leq g$. In particular, $\mu_g:C_g \to J(C)$ is
birational.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
For $d\leq g = \dim H^{0}(\omega_{C})$,  a divisor $D$ that is the sum of $d$ general points $p_{1}, \dots,  p_{d} \in C$ will impose independent vanishing conditions on the sections of $\omega_{C}$, and thus
$$
h^0(\omega_C(-D)) = g-d.
$$
 Using this, the
\index{Riemann--Roch formula}%
Riemann--Roch formula
gives $h^{0}(\cO_{C}(D)) = 1$, so the fiber of
$\mu_{d}$ consists of a single point, proving generic injectivity.

If $d \geq g$ then $h^0(\omega_C(-D)) = 0$ and hence $r(D) = d-g= \dim C_{d} - \dim J(C)$, and it follows that the image of $C_d$ has dimension $g$. Since $C_d$ is compact and $J(C)$ is irreducible, $\mu_{d}$ is surjective.

\subsubsection*{The differential of the Abel--Jacobi map}

\begin{theorem}
The Abel--Jacobi map
\index{Abel--Jacobi map}%
$\mu_{1}: C\to \Pic_{1}(C)$ is a closed embedding.
If $p\in C$ is a point on a smooth projective curve of genus $g>0$ then the
\index{cotangent space}%
cotangent space
of $C$
at $p$ is $\kappa(p) \otimes \omega_{C}$ and the cotangent space to $\Pic_{1}$ at $\mu_{1}(p)$ is
$H^{0}(\omega_{C})$ where $\kappa(p) \cong \CC$ is the residue class
field at $p$. With these identifications the
cotangent map
\index{cotangent map}%
$$
T^{*}(\mu_{1}): H^{0}(\omega_{C})  \to \kappa(p) \otimes \omega_{C}
$$
is evaluation at $p$, which is surjective, with kernel
$H^{0}(\omega_{C}(-p))$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
Since $g(C)$
is positive
distinct points $p, q \in C$ cannot be linearly equivalent, so the
Abel--Jacobi map $\mu_1$ is set-theoretically
injective. To prove that it is an embedding, we must show
that its differential is
everywhere nonzero.

To compute the differential of $\mu_1$ at a point $p\in C$ we choose a
local parameter $z$ at $p$, so that any differential form on a
neighborhood of $p$ has the form $f(z)@dz$. We may thus write the
cotangent space to $C$ at $p$ as
$\kappa(p) \otimes \omega_{C} \cong \CC@dz$. The tangent space to
$J(C) = H^0(\omega_C)^*/H_1(C, \ZZ)$ at any point is
$H^0(\omega_C)^*` `$, so the
\index{cotangent space}%
cotangent space
is $H^0(\omega_C)$.

The map $\mu_{1}$ sends each point $q$ to
\vspace*{-2pt}
$$
\mu_1 : C \to J(C) \colonequals H^0(\omega_C)^*/H_1(C, \ZZ),
\quad q \mapsto \!\int_p^q \!.
\vspace*{-2pt}
$$
The
\index{fundamental theorem of calculus}%
fundamental theorem of calculus
tells us the derivative of an integral:
for any $q\in C$ close to $p$ we have
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial q} \int_p^q \!f(z)dz = f(q).
$$
It follows that
the
\index{codifferential}%
codifferential
$T^*(\mu_1)$ of $\mu_1$ is the natural restriction map $H^0(\omega_{C}) \to \kappa(p) \otimes \omega_{C}$ sending
a differential form to its value at $p$. Thus the kernel of $T^*(\mu_1)$ evaluated at $p$ is the space of differential forms vanishing
at $p$, that is
$H^{0}(\omega_{C}(-p))$. Since $\omega_{C}$ is basepoint free, there is a differential form not vanishing at $p$,
so  $T^*(\mu_1)$ is surjective, proving that
the differential of $\mu_{1}$ is injective as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The composition of the map $\mu_{1}: C \to \Pic_{1}(C)$ with the
Gauss map
\index{Gauss map}%
that sends a point $\mu_{1}(p)$
to the tangent line to $\mu_{1}(C)$ at $p$ is the
canonical embedding.
\index{canonical embedding}%
\unif
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Since
the kernel of $T^*(\mu_1)(p)$ is  the hyperplane $H^{0}\omega_{C}(-p))\subset H^{0}(\omega_{C})$, the differential
of $\mu_{1}$ carries the tangent space to $C$ at $p$ to the line
in $H^0(\omega_C)^*$ corresponding to the hyperplane $H^0(\omega_C(-p))\subset H^0(\omega_C)$.
This is the image of $p$ in $\PP(H^{0}(\omega_{C})) = \PP^{g-1}$ under the
canonical map.
\end{proof}


\section{The $g+3$ theorem}\label{g+3 section}

The Picard varieties are mysterious objects.  But even the
existence of
a  moduli space for invertible sheaves of degree $d$ on $C$, and
the fact
that this space is an irreducible algebraic variety of dimension $g$,
suffice to prove nontrivial results.

We proved in Corollary~\ref{degree 2g+1 embedding} that every divisor
of degree $\geq 2g+1$ is very ample, and this is sharp as stated: on
any curve $C$ there exist divisors of every degree $d \leq 2g$ that
are not very ample. But if we look at a \emph{general} divisor $D$ of
degree $d$ on  $C$, we can do much better:

\begin{theorem}[$g+3$ theorem]\label{g+3 theorem}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$. If $D \in C_{g+3}$
is a general effective divisor of degree $g+3$ on $C$, then $D$ is
very ample.
\index{very ample.}%
\index{g@$g+3$ theorem}%
Thus
every curve of genus $g$
can
be embedded in $\PP^3$ as a curve of degree $g+3$.

Moreover, this is sharp: if $g\geq 2$ and $C$ is
hyperelliptic,
\index{hyperelliptic}%
then no invertible sheaf of degree $\leq g+2$ is very ample on $C$.
\end{theorem}

This is not the final word on low-degree embeddings of curves: if we look at a general curve $C$, Theorem~\ref{grd omnibus} says that $C$ can in fact be embedded in $\PP^{3}$ as a curve of degree $d = \lceil 3g/4 \rceil + 3$, and can be birationally embedded in $\PP^2$ as a nodal curve of degree $d = \lceil 2g/3 \rceil + 2$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{g+3 theorem}]
If
$D$ is general of degree $g+3$ then $D$ is nonspecial,
so $h^0(\cO_C(D)) = 4$. By Proposition~\ref{very ample} the divisor
$D$ is very ample if and only if $h^0(\cO_C(D-F)) = 2$
for every effective divisor $F = p+q$ of degree 2 on $C$.

If, on the contrary, $h^0(\cO_C(D-F)) \geq 3$ then by the
Riemann--Roch theorem
\index{Riemann--Roch theorem}%
$h^0(\omega_C(-D + F)) \geq 1$
so $K_C - D + F$ is  linearly equivalent to
an effective divisor $E$ of degree $g-3$.

Now, consider the map
$\nu : C_{g-3} \times C_{2}  \to  J(C)$
given by
$$
\nu : (E,F) \; \mapsto \; \mu_{g-3}(K_C - E + F) = \mu_{2g-2}(K_C) - \mu_{g-3}(E) + \mu_{2}(F),
$$
where the $+$ and $-$ on the right refer to the group law on $J(C)$.

By what we have just said and
Abel's theorem,
\index{Abel's theorem}%
the divisor $D$ is very ample if and only if
$\mu(D)$
is not in the image of $\nu$.
However the source of $\nu$ has dimension $g-3+2 = g-1$, so its image
in $J(C)$ is a proper subvariety. Since $\mu_{g+3}$ is surjective, the
image of a general divisor $D \in C_{g-3}$ is a general point of
$J(C)$ and thus will not lie in the image of $\nu$.

To prove that $g+3$ is sharp for hyperelliptic curves, recall that a
\index{hyperelliptic curve}%
smooth plane curve $C$ of genus
at least $2$
has degree $d\geq 4$ and canonical class
$\omega_{C} = \sO_{C}(d-\nobreak 3)$, which is very ample.
This shows that
no hyperelliptic curve  can
be embedded in the plane.

Thus every very ample divisor $D$ on a hyperelliptic curve  has $h^0(D) \geq 3$. If also $\deg D \leq g+2$
then $D$ is a special divisor. By Corollary \ref{special on hyperelliptic}, $D$ would have the form
$rD_0$, where $D_0$ is the $g^1_2$, the unique divisor of degree 2 with 2 independent sections,
and $r \leq (g+2)/2$. But the smallest multiple of the $D_0$ that is very ample is $(g+1)D_0$, and
since $g\geq 2$ we have $(g+2)/2 < g+1$, so $D$ is not very ample.
\unif
\end{proof}

It would be natural to speculate that a general divisor of degree $g+2$ defines a map to $\PP^2$ whose
image has only nodes as singularities, but this is not quite true. Here is the correct result,
whose proof we give in
Theorem~\ref{needed for nodes}
because it depends on a general position result that
we will prove in Section~\ref{linearly general position section}.

\begin{theorem}[$g+2$ theorem]\label{g+2 theorem}
Let $C$ be any smooth projective curve of genus $g$, and let $D$ be a general divisor of degree $g+2$ on $C$.
\index{g@$g+2$ theorem}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $C$ is
not
hyperelliptic then the map $\phi_D : C \to \PP^2$ is birational onto its
image $C_0$, and $C_0$ is a plane curve of degree $g+2$ with exactly
$\tbinom{g}{2}$
nodes
\index{nodes}%
and no other singularities.
\item If $C$ is hyperelliptic then the map $\phi_D : C \to \PP^2$ is
  birational onto its image $C_0$, and $C_0$ is a plane curve of
  degree $g+2$ with one ordinary
$g$-fold point
\index{$g$-fold point}%
 and no other
  singularities.
%\vspace{-1.4\baselineskip}
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\section{The schemes $W^r_d(C)$}

Now that we have a parameter space $\Pic_d(C)$ for invertible sheaves
\index{parameter space}%
of degree $d$, we can ask about the geometry of the set of invertible
sheaves defining linear series of dimension $\geq r$, that is,
\index{W0dr@$W_d(C)$, $W^r_d(C)$|defi}%
$$
W^r_d(C) \colonequals \{ \cL \in \Pic_d(C) \mid h^0(\cL) \geq r+1 \}.
$$
Thus, for example, $W^0_d(C)$ is the locus of effective divisor
classes, the image of the map $\mu : C_d \to \Pic_d(C)$. We often omit
the 0 in this case and write this simply as $W^{}_d(C)$.

$W_d^r(C)$ can also be characterized as the locus
$$
W^r_d(C)= \left\{ \cL \in \Pic_d(C) \mid {\dim \mu^{-1}(\cL)} \geq r @\right\},
$$
where $\mu : C_d \to \pic_d(C)$ is the
Abel--Jacobi map.
\index{Abel--Jacobi map}%
By the upper semicontinuity of fiber dimension,
the support of $W^r_d(C)$ is a Zariski-closed subset,
 so we can talk about its dimension, irreducibility, smoothness or singularity and so on. The preimage $\mu^{-1}(W^r_d(C)) \subset C_d$ is the set of effective divisors $D$ with $r(D) \geq r$, and is denoted $C^r_d$.
\index{notation!$C^r_d$}%

The set $W^r_d(C)$ can be given the structure of a scheme;
see \cite[Section IV.3]{ACGH}.
With this structure,
it is a
fine moduli space
\index{fine moduli space}%
representing the functor of families of
invertible sheaves with $r+1$ or more sections (that is, the functor
that associates to a scheme $B$ the set of invertible sheaves $\cL$ on
$B \times C$ such that the pushforward $(\pi_2)_*\cL$ has a locally
free subsheaf of rank $r+1$ over every
curvilinear%
\index{curvilinear scheme}%
\footnote{This word means the Zariski tangent space has dimension at most 1 everywhere.}
subscheme of~$B$,
as always modulo tensoring with pullbacks of invertible sheaves on $B$).
In Chapter~\ref{genus 4, 5 Chapter} we will see examples of
curves $C$ of genus 4 for which the scheme $W^1_3(C)$ is reducible,
and in Chapter~\ref{BNChapter} we will see curves $C$ of genus 6 for
which the scheme $W^1_4(C)$ is nonreduced\emdash in fact, in one case
isomorphic to $\Spec \CC[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^5)$.

\section{Examples in low genus}

\subsection*{Genus 1}

If $C$
has
genus 1, then since the Abel--Jacobi map $\mu : C \to \Pic_1(C)$ is
always an embedding, it is an isomorphism, and also $\Pic_d(C) \cong
C$ for all $d$. If we fix any point $p \in C$, we get a map $C \to
\Pic_0(C)$ sending $q \in C$ to the invertible sheaf $\cO_C(q-p)$,
which is again an isomorphism.

The fact that a curve of genus 1 over $\CC$ is the quotient of the complex plane by a lattice $\Lambda \subset \CC$ has an immediate consequence:

\begin{corollary}\label{finite automorphism genus 1}
If $E$ is a smooth projective curve of genus 1 and $p \in E$ any point, there are only finitely many automorphisms $\phi : E \to E$ with $\phi(p) = p$.
\unif
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof} The choice of $p$ allows us to identify $C$ with $\CC/\Lambda$ for some lattice $\Lambda$.
Any automorphism $\phi$ lifts to a linear map $\tilde \phi : \CC \to \CC$ carrying $\Lambda$ to itself.
\end{proof}


\subsection*{Genus 2}

The map $\mu_2 : C_{2} \to J(C)$ is an isomorphism except along the
locus $\Gamma \subset  C_{2} $ of divisors of the unique $g^1_2$ on
$C$. In fact, the symmetric square $ C_{2} $ of $C$ is the
\index{blowup!of $J(C)$}%
blowup of $J(C)$%
at the point corresponding to the invertible sheaf
corresponding to the
$g^1_2$; see Exercise~\ref{blowup of $J(C)$ at a point}.


\subsection*{Genus 3}
Let $C$ be a curve of genus 3. The geometry of the map $\mu_2$
depends on whether or not $C$ is hyperelliptic. If it is, $\mu_2$
will collapse the locus in $C_2$ of divisors of the hyperelliptic
$g^1_2$ to a point, but is otherwise one-to-one, and $W_2(C)$ is
singular.  If $C$ is not hyperelliptic, by contrast, $\mu_2$ is an
embedding, and $W_2(C)$ is smooth.

\meshing
The birational surjection $\mu_3 = \mu_g$ is the blowup of
$J(C) \cong \Pic_3(C)$ along the locus $W^1_3(C)$. At the same time, we know
that
$$
W^1_3(C) = K - W_1(C),
$$
in the sense that any invertible sheaf $\sL$ defining a $g^1_3$ has, by the
\index{Riemann--Roch theorem,}%
Riemann--Roch theorem,
the form $\omega_C\otimes \sL'$,
where $\sL'$ has degree 1 and $h^0(\sL') = 1$,
so $W^1_3$ is isomorphic to $C$. Thus $C_{3}$ is the blowup of $J(C)$ along the curve $C$.
See \cite[pp.~53--54]{MumfordCJ} for a discussion.

\section{Martens' theorem}

If $C$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ and $r\leq d-g$, then
by the
Riemann--Roch theorem
\index{Riemann--Roch theorem}%
 $W^{r}_{d} = \Pic_{d}$. On the other hand
Clifford's theorem
\index{Clifford's theorem}%
says that if $C$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ and $d\leq 2g-2$
  then the set
 $W^r_d(C)$ is empty when $d-2r<0$. Martens' theorem extends Clifford's theorem to the statement
 $\dim W^r_{d} \leq d-2r$ whenever $r>d-g$.
\label{Martens' theorem}%

\begin{npt}
\begin{theorem}[\cite{Martens}]\label{Martens' inequality}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$. If $r > d-g$, then
$$
\dim(W^r_d(C)) \leq d-2r;
$$
moreover, equality holds for some $r$ in this range if and only if $d=2g-2$ and $r= g-1$ (in which case $W^r_d(C) = \{\omega_C\}$) or
$d=r=0$ (in which case $W^r_d(C) = \{\sO_C\}$) or $C$ is
hyperelliptic.
\index{hyperelliptic}%
In the last case, equality holds for all $d$ and $r$ with $d\geq 2r > 2(d-g)$.
\unif
\end{theorem}
\end{npt}

Given
a smooth projective curve $C \subset \PP^r` `$, we write $
\Sigma^r_d
\subset C_d$
\index{notation!$\Sigma^r_d$}%
for the locus of effective divisors $D$ of degree $d$ on
$C$ with $\dim \overkern20 D \leq d-r-1$. This is a closed condition, so
$\Sigma^r_d$ is an algebraic subset. Using the
geometric Riemann--Roch theorem
%geometric Riemann--Roch theorem
%\index{geometric Riemann--Roch theorem}%
%\index{Riemann--Roch theorem!geometric}%
we will reduce the inequality in Martens' theorem to the following.

\begin{lemma}[elementary secant plane lemma]\label{elementary secant plane lemma}
Let
\index{secant plane lemma}%
$C \subset \PP^r$ be a smooth, nondegenerate curve. If $d \leq r$ and $r \geq 0$ then
$$
\dim \Sigma^r_d \leq d-r.
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\Sigma^0_d = C^d` `$, the conclusion is immediate for $r=0$.

Suppose that  $D\in \Sigma^r_d$ with $r>0$. Since $\dim \overkern20 D\leq d-r-1\leq d-2$ the plane
$\Lambda$ spanned by $D$ is already spanned by some divisor  $D' \colonequals D -p$ of degree $d-1$,
obtained by subtracting one point  in the support of $D$.
It follows that for points $q\notin \Lambda \cap C$, the divisor $q+D'$ spans a plane of dimension $\leq d-r$,
so $q+D'\in \Sigma^{r-1}_{d}$.
Furthermore,  $D$ is in the closure of the set of divisors
$$
\{q+D' \mid q\notin \Lambda \cap C \}.
$$
From this we see that $\Sigma^r_d\setminus \Sigma^{r-1}_d$ is in the closure of  $\Sigma^{r-1}_d$. It follows that
$$
\dim \Sigma^0_d >  \dim \Sigma^1_d > \dots > \dim \Sigma^r_d,
$$
and thus $\dim \Sigma^r_d \leq d-r$ as claimed.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Martens' inequality]
 The listed cases of equality are easy to verify: for example on a hyperelliptic curve Corollary~\ref{special on hyperelliptic} shows that a special invertible sheaf with  $r(\sL) = s$ can be written $\sL_0^{\otimes s}(p_1+\cdots + p_{d-2s})$, where
$\sL_0$ is the unique $\g^1_2$ on $C$ and the $p_i$ are basepoints\emdash a family of dimension $d-2s$.
We postpone the proof that these are the only cases of equality to Theorem~\ref{full Martens}, which we prove
using a stronger version of Lemma~\ref{elementary secant plane lemma} that is a corollary of Theorem~\ref{uniform position lemma}.

Since we have assumed $r>d-g$, the set $W^r_d(C)$ contains only  sheaves
 $\sL$ with $h^1(\sL)\neq 0$. For such sheaves there is a one-to-one
correspondence $\sL \mapsto \omega_C\otimes \sL^{-1}$ inducing an isomorphism
$$
\bigl\{\sL \in W^r_d(C) \mid h^1(\sL) \neq 0 @\bigr\}= \bigl\{\sL \in W^{g-1-d+r}_{2g-2-d} \mid h^1(\sL) \neq 0 @\bigl\}
.
$$
Since
$$
2g-2-d - 2(g-1-d+r) = d-2r,
$$
it will suffice to prove the theorem in case $d \leq g-1$.

Let $C^r_d\subset C_d$ be the preimage of $W^r_d(C)$. Since the fibers of $C^r_d$ over points of
$W^r_d(C)$ have dimension at least $r$, Marten's inequality will follow from the inequality
$$
\dim C^r_d \; \leq \; d-r.
$$
\meshing
Let $\phi_K: C\to \PP^g-1$ be the canonical map. By the
geometric Riemann--Roch theorem
\index{geometric Riemann--Roch theorem}%
\index{Riemann--Roch theorem!geometric}%
(Theorem~\ref{geometric RR}),
$r(D) = \deg D -1 -\dim\overlow{\phi_K(D)}$,
so $D\in C^r_d$ if and only if
$\dim \overlow{\phi_K(D)}\leq d-r-1$. Since $d\leq g-1$ we may apply  Lemma~\ref{elementary secant plane lemma}, showing that the set of such $D$ has dimension $\leq d-r$, as required.
\end{proof}


If $C$ is hyperelliptic with $g^1_2 = |D|$ then for $r\leq g-1$ we have $\mu(rD) \in W^r_{2r}$ and
$$
W^r_d(C) \supset W_{d-2r}(C) + \mu(rD).
$$
In fact this is an equality by
Corollary
\ref{special on hyperelliptic}.
Since $W_{d-2r}(C)$ has dimension $d-2r$, we see that Martens' theorem is sharp.

The theorem can be extended to show
\index{Martens' theorem!extensions}%
that $\dim W^r_d(C) < d-2r$ in certain cases;
see for example \cite{Mumford-Prym1,Keem,Coppens}.

\item by applying the
adjunction formula
\index{adjunction formula}%
 to $C \subset J(C)$; and
\item by calculating the self-intersection of its preimage
$C + p \subset C_2$ and using the geometry of the
Abel--Jacobi map $\mu_2 : C_2 \to J(C)$.

\begin{exercise}
Let $C$ be a curve of genus 2, and consider the map $\nu : C \times C
\to \Pic_0(C)$ defined by sending $(p, q)\in C \times C$ to the
invertible sheaf $\cO_C(p-q)$. Show that this map is
generically finite,
\index{generically finite}%
and compute its degree.

\begin{exercise} \label{comparison with geometric RR}
Let $C^{r}_{d}$ be the preimage of $W^{r}_{d}$, the set of divisors moving in at least an $r$-dimensional linear series.
Show that the image of the
differential of the Abel--Jacobi map

\begin{exercise}[$g+1$ theorem]\label{g+1 theorem}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$.
\index{g@$g+1$ theorem}%
If $D \in C_{g+1}$ is a
general effective divisor
\index{general divisor}%
of degree $g+1$ on $C$, then
$D$ is basepoint free and defines a  map to $\PP^1$ that has only
simple ramification, with $2g+2$ distinct

\begin{exercise}\label{blowup of $J(C)$ at a point}
Let $C$ be a curve of genus 2. The canonical map $\phi_K : C \to
\PP^1$ expresses $C$ as a
\index{2-sheeted cover}%
2-sheeted cover
 of $\PP^1` `$, and we have
correspondingly an involution $\tau : C \to C$ exchanging points in
the fibers of $\phi_K$ (equivalently, for any $p \in C$, we have
$h^0(K_C(-p)) = 1$; $\tau$ will send $p$ to the unique zero of the
unique section $\sigma \in H^0(K_C(-p))$). Let $\Gamma \subset C
\times C$ be the graph of $\tau$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the fact that a birational morphism of smooth surfaces
\index{birational morphism}%
  is the inverse of a sequence of blowups of reduced points
  \cite[Chapter V, Theorem 5.5]{Hartshorne1977},
show the self-intersection of the
  image $C^1_2$ of $\Gamma$ in $C_2$ is $-1$.
\item Find the
self-intersection
\index{self-intersection}%
of $\Gamma$ in $C \times C$.
