1.1: either in the figure or in the caption or both it should indicate that p+q+r and p+q'+r' are divisors in the linear system
corresponding to the map from the curve on the left to the curve on the right. The label C_0 = \phi(C) should apply to the curve in the circle, not
to the circle.

1.2: the curve in the plane should intersect itself

1.3: the line passing through 2pm *looks* transverse to the plane of the curve there, and the points q_1, q_2 don't look aligned with their image. I'm not sure exactly how to improve this, but it looks wrong.

2.1 -- looks fine

2.2 -- wrong figure. What goes here should be what is now labeled 2-3a - d

2.3 -- this should be the figure labeled 2-4 

3.2 --  the -> should be a minus sign. also, should be 3.1

3.1 -- not good also, should be 3.2

4.1 still to be drawn
