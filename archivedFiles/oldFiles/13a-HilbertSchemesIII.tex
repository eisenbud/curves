\chapter{Hilbert Schemes III: The rest of the Hilbert Scheem} 
\label{TwistedCubics}

In this section we will give the description of all of the Hilbert scheme of twisted cubics.
\fix{ mention Ellia-Hirschowitz-Mezzetti 1992: the number of components not bounded by a poly
in d and g. Also, Joachim Jelisiejew has proved Murphy for points in $A^{16}$ and he says his student showed that 13 points in $A^{6}$ has an everywhere nonreduced component.}

%You, dear reader, can spare us this anguish: just prove the nonexistence of rigid curves, and we'll all be happy.
