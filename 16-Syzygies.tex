In Chapter~\ref{linkageChapter} we used the resolutions of curves in $\PP^3$ to their Hartshorne-Rao modules. The
simplest case was that in which the Hartshorne-Rao module vanishes, that is, the case of arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curves.
In this chapter, after a review of some key ideas from homological commutative algebra, we will show that curves embedded by complete linear series of high degree, and also canonical curves, are arithmetically
Cohen-Macaulay. We will then introduce the Eagon-Northcott complexes, and explain their relation to the resolutions of canonical curves. We close the chapter with an explanation of Green's conjecture, which proposes a a way in which the intrinsic geometry
of a curve may be connected to the shape of its minimal free resolution of its ideal in the canonical embedding.


\section{Free resolutions and the Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein conditions}
This section contains few proofs; the material may be found in~\cite[Chapter ****]{Eisenbud1995}.

\begin{remark}
 There are two related contexts in which the results of this section can be used: over a local ring and, with graded modules and homogeneous ideals, over a polynomial ring whose variables have positive degree. These are parallel essentially because Nakayama's Lemma works in both cases. They can be unified by working with graded modules over positively graded rings whose degree 0 component is a local ring, but rather than worry the reader with this generality we will simply work with local rings or polynomial rings over a field with variables in degree 1, and trust the reader to apply the results in the other case when necessary.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Free resolutions}
Let $(R,\gm, k)$ be a local ring and let $M$ be a finitely generated module. A \emph{free resolution} of $M$ is an exact complex
$$
\FF: \cdots \rTo F_s \rTo^{\phi_s} F_{s-1} \rTo^{\phi_{s-1}} \cdots \rTo F_1 \rTo^{\phi_1}  F_0 \rTo M \rTo 0.
$$
The resolution is \emph{minimal} if a minimal set of generators of $F_i$ maps to a minimal set of generators of the kernel of the following map,
or equivalently (by Nakayama's Lemma) the maps in $\FF\otimes_R k$ are all 0.

The first examples of a minimal free resolution are the Koszul complexes, which resolve $R/I$ when
 $I = (f_1,\dots, f_t)$
is a complete intersection, that is, $f_1,\dots, f_t$ is a regular sequence.  For $t = 2,3$ these look like
$$
\begin{aligned}
 0\rTo &R \rTo^{
\begin{pmatrix}
-f_2\\f_1
\end{pmatrix}}
 R^2\rTo^{
 \begin{pmatrix}
f_1&f_2
\end{pmatrix}}
 R \rTo R/I \rTo 0\\
%%
0\rTo R \rTo^{
\begin{pmatrix}
f_1\\f_2\\f_3
\end{pmatrix}} R^3&\rTo{
\begin{pmatrix}
 0&f_3&-f_2\\
 -f_3&0&f_1\\
 f_2&-f_1&0
\end{pmatrix}}
 R^3\rTo^{
 \begin{pmatrix}
f_1&f_2&f3
\end{pmatrix}}R \rTo R/I \rTo 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Minimal free resolutions of a given module $M$ are all isomorphic, and the \emph{projective dimension}  $\pd(M) = \pd_R(M)$ is their length, the number of nonzero
maps (possibly infinity). Equivalently, 
$$
\pd\ M = \max\{s \mid \Ext_R^s(M,k) \neq 0.
$$
Fundamental
results of Auslander, Buchsbaum and Serre say that $R$ is \emph{regular}---that is, the Krull dimension of $R$ is equal to the minimal number
of generators of $\gm$---if and only if the minimal free resolution of the residue field is finite, in which case
the minimal free resolution of every module is finite. 

\subsection{Depth and the Cohen-Macaulay property}
The Auslander-Buchsbaum formula expresses the projective dimension of a module in the case where the projective dimension is finite. We will restrict to the case of most interest to us, that of a graded module $M$ over a polynomial ring $S$; but the
theory for a regular local ring is exactly parallel, and the theorem is true over an arbitrary local ring if we restrict to modules of finite projective dimension.

\begin{definition}
 The \emph{depth of $M$} is the maximal length of sequence of homogeneous polynomials $f_1,\dots,f_m \in S$ of positive degree such that $f_1$ is a nonzerodivisor on $M$, $f_2$ is a nonzerodivisor on $M/(f_1M)$, and so on. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Auslander-Buchsbaum formula]\label{AB formula}
If $M$ is a finitely generated graded module over $S = \CC[x_0,\dots, x_r]$  then
$$
\pd M = \dim S - \depth M
$$
and this is $\geq \codim \ann_S M$, the codimension of the annihilator of $M$.
\end{theorem}

Thus the depth of an $S$-module $M$ is equal to the dimension of $M$ if and only if the projective dimension
of $M$ is equal to the codimension of $M$; In this case we say that $M$ is a
\emph{Cohen-Macaulay module}. It follows from the characterization that every localization of a Cohen-Macaulay
module is again Cohen-Macaulay.

As we showed in Chapter~\ref{linkageChapter}, a curve $C\subset \PP^3$ is linked to a complete intersection
if and only if  $H^1_*(\sI_C) := \oplus_{m\in \ZZ} H^1(\sI_C(m)) = 0$, in which case $C$ is said to be is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. Here is the connection between these notions: 

\begin{proposition}\label{meaning of ACM}
A projective curve $C \subset \PP^r$  has $H^1_*(\sI_C) = 0$ if and only if the homogeneous coordinate ring of $C$
is Cohen-Macaulay or, equivalently, the depth of the homogeneous  coordinate ring of $C$ is 2.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
 From the exact sequence
$$
0\to I_C \to S \to S/I_C \to  H^0_*( \sO_C) \to H^1_*(\sI_C) \to 0,
$$
we see that $H^1_*(\sI_C) = 0$ if and only if the natural map $S/I_C\to H^0_*(\sO_C)$ is an isomorphism. 
Moreover, for any purely 1-dimensional projective scheme $C$ the $S$-module $H^0_*(\sO_C)$ is finitely generated and
a has depth 2; this follows because
a general form $f_1$ does not vanish identically on any component of $C$, and modulo $f_1$ we get a submodule of $H^0_*(\sO_\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is the intersction of $C$ with the vanishing locus of $f_1$. Moreover any submodule of $H^0_*(\sO_\Gamma)$ has depth
1 because any form that is nonzero at every point of the (finite) support of $\Gamma$ is a nonzerodivisor.

Conversely, if $S/I\neq H^0_*( \sO_C)$, then since $H^0_*( \sO_C)/(S/I)$ has finite length, this quotient has depth 0,
and it follows from Lemma~\ref{depth lemma} below that $S/I$ has depth 1.
\end{proof}

More generally, we say that a subscheme $X\subset \PP^r$ is \emph{arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay}
if $H^1(\sI_{X/\PP^r}(m)) = 0$ for all $m$ and also $H^i(\sO_X(m)) = 0$ for all $m$ and all $0<i<\dim X$,
and this is equivalent to the Cohen-Macaulay property of $S/(I_X)$. As with the case of curves,
the condition that $H^1(\sI_{X/\PP^r}(m)) = 0$ 
is strongly dependent on the embedding. Using Theorem~\ref{WMACE} below one can show
that $X$ is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay if and only if the dual of the minimal $S$-free resolution
of $S/I_X$ is the minimal $S$-free resolution of $\omega_{S/I_X}$, where as usual $S$ is the
homogeneous coordinate ring of $\PP^r$.

\begin{exercise}
Prove that if $X\subset \PP^r$ is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay then the dual of the minimal free resolution of $S/I_X$
is the minimal free resolution of $\omega_X$. Hint:Use Theorem~\ref{WMACE} and the characterization of $\omega_{S/I_X}$
as an Ext module.
\end{exercise}

By contrast, the condition
that $H^i(\sO_X(m)) = 0$ for all $m$ and all $0<i<\dim X$, which is in any case trivial for curves, is 
equivalent to saying that $X$ is \emph{locally Cohen-Macaulay}: the local rings of $X$ are all Cohen-Macaulay (that is, their depth is equal to their dimension). This is the case for any purely 1-dimensional scheme. 

Usually the adjective ``locally'' is omitted. Instead, the 
modifier ``arithmetically'' is added when the homogeneous coordinate ring is Cohen-Macaulay (which implies the local condition).

The \emph{depth lemma} \cite[***]{Eisenbud1995} is a useful tool for computing the depth:

\begin{lemma}\label{depth lemma}
If 
$$
0\to A\to B\to C\to 0
$$
is a short exact sequence of finitely generated modules over a local or positively graded ring $R$ then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\depth B \geq \min\{\depth A, \depth C\}$;
 \item If $\depth B>\depth C$ then $\depth A = \depth C -1$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{exercise}
 Prove Lemma~\ref{depth lemma} for modules over a regular local ring.  Hint: use the characterization of depth
 via projective dimension.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{The Gorenstein property} 
Another important homological condition is the condition that $\omega_X$ is an invertible sheaf; when this holds, $X$ is \emph{quasi-Gorenstein}. When, in addtition, $X$ is Cohen-Macaulay we say that $X$ is \emph{Gorenstein}. Any scheme that is locally a complete intersection, such as any smooth scheme and any plane curve, is Gorenstein. Since the restriction
of $\sO_{\PP^r}(1)$ to a subvariety is always invertible, saying that a scheme $X$ is canonically embedded implies that
$X$ is at least quasi-Gorenstein. As with the Cohen-Macaulay property, the Gorenstein property is interpreted locally
on a scheme. We say that a projective scheme $X$ is \emph{arithmetically Gorenstein}
if it's homogeneous coordinate ring is Gorenstein, and it follows that $\omega_{S/I} \cong S/I(a)$ for some integer $a = a(X)$.

If $X$ is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, so that
$\pd(X) = codim(X)$,  then since 
$$
(S/I)(a) \cong \omega_{S/I_X} \cong \Ext^{\codim X}(S/I, S)(-r-1),
$$
it follows that if $X$ is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, then $X$ is  \emph{arithmetically Gorenstein} if and only if
the  minimal free resolution of $S/I$ is isomorphic, up to shift, to its own dual. We have seen an example already
in the Koszul complex (a complete intersection is Gorenstein) and we will see more examples
below.

\begin{exercise}
In dealing with arithmetically Gorenstein schemes, we used the fact that if $\omega_{S/I}$ is an invertible
sheaf (over $\Spec(S/I)$) then it is isomorphic to $S/I(a)$ for some $a$. Why is this true?
\end{exercise}

\section{Curves of high degree}\label{high degree ACM}
Let $C$ be a smooth curve of  genus $g$. We have seen that every invertible sheaf of degree $d \geq 2g+1$ is very ample. We will now show that
such a curve,  embedded by the corresponding complete linear series, is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay.

\begin{theorem}\label{high degree ACM}
If $C\subset \PP^r$ is an integral projective curve, embedded by a complete linear series $|D|$ of degree $d\geq 2p_a(C)+1$, then
the restriction maps 
$$
H^0(\sO_{\PP^{r}}(m)) \to H^0(\sO_C(m))
$$
 are surjective for all $m$. Equivalently, $H^1(\sI_C(m)) = 0$ for all $m$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
Find a degree 6 embedding of a curve of genus 3 that is not arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, and another that is.
Hint: Show that the $3\times 3$ minors of a general matrix of linear forms defines a Cohen-Macaulay curve
of genus 3. \fix{What's the best way to find a nonCM example? How about $K-p +q+r$ for general $p,q,r$?
Does this need computation?}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof} We do induction on $m$, noting that
For $m\leq 1$ the conclusion is immediate. 

The case $m=2$ requires a special argument. Note that the complete linear series
embeds $C$ in $\PP^{r}$.  Let $H$ be a general hyperlane in $\PP^{r}$.
 By Theorem~\ref{linear general position} the $d$ points $\Gamma = C\cap H$ are in linearly general position. By Proposition~\ref{arbitrary hyperplane} they span $H \cong \PP^{r}$.
 
By the Riemann-Roch theorem $r = d-p_a$. The inequality $d\geq 2p_a+1$ is equivalent to the statement that $d\leq 2(r-1)+1$ so by Lemma~\ref{min hilb} the points of $\Gamma$ impose $d$ conditions on quadrics.
This implies that
the restriction map $H^0(\sO_{\PP^{r}}(2))\to H^0(\sO_H(2)) \to H^0(\sO_{\Gamma/H}(2))$ is surjective, whence $H^1(\sI_\Gamma(2)) = 0.$

Applying $H^1$ to exact sequence 
$$
0\to \sI_C(1) \to \sI_C(2) \to \sI_{\Gamma/H}(2) \to 0
$$
of Proposition~\ref{arbitrary hyperplane}
we see that $H^1(\sI_C(2))=0$.

Now suppose that  $m>2$. By induction, it suffices to show that the multiplication map
$$
H^0(\sO_C(1) \otimes H^0(\sO_C(m-1)\to H^0(\sO_{C}(m))
$$
is surjective.

For this we use what David Mumford has called the \emph{base-point-free pencil trick}:
Let $V$ be a pair of sections of $H^0(\sO_{\PP^{d-g}}(1)) = H^0(\sO_C(1))$ that do not intersect anywhere on $C$ (and thus define a base-point-free pencil on $C$).
Since $V\otimes \sO_{C}(m-1)\to \sO_{C}(m)$ is an epimorphism, it follows that the kernel $\sL$ is an invertible sheaf.
From the exact sequence
$$
0\to \sL \to V\otimes \sO_{C}(m-1) \to \sO_{C}(m) \to 0
$$
we see that
$$
\sL \otimes \sO_{C}(m) \cong  \wedge^2(V\otimes \sO_{C}(m-1))\cong \sO_C(2m-2).
$$
Thus $\sL \cong \sO_C(m-2)$.
Though not necessary for the argument, we note that we have described a Koszul complex
$$
0\to \wedge^2V \otimes \sO_C(m-2) \to V\otimes \sO_{C}(m-1)\to \sO_{C}(m)\to 0,
$$
and we could have argued directly from criteria for the exactness of such sequences.

Since $m\geq 3$ we have $\deg(\sO_C(m-2)) \geq d > 2p_a-2$, so $H^1(\sO_C(m-2)) =0$, and it follows that the map $V\otimes H^0(\sO_{C}(m-1))\to H^0(\sO_{C}(m))$
is surjective. Thus  
$H^0(\sO_C(1))\otimes H^0(\sO_{C}(m-1))\to H^0(\sO_{C}(m))$
is surjective, completing the proof.
\end{proof}


\section{Canonical Curves}\label{canonical ACM}
A slightly more subtle argument will show that
canonical curves are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, a result (in the smooth case) of~\cite{Noether-canonical} that we have been using ever since Section~\ref{Noether theorem section}.
The necessary modification is to replace the base-point-free pencil with one having many base points in a controlled way.
We follow the treatment in \cite{Schreyer}. 

If $C$ is an integral curve then by Theorem~\ref{linear general position} a general hyperplane $H\subset \PP^{g-1}$
meets $C$ transversely in a set of points in linearly general position. Any subset $\Gamma$ of $g-2$ of these points will span a $(g-3)$-plane $\Lambda$
meeting $C$ transversely in $\Gamma$, and we call $\Lambda$ a \emph{simple $(g-2)$-secant $(g-3)$-plane}. 

\begin{theorem}\label{canonical curves are ACM}
If $C\subset \PP^{g-1}$ is a  canonically embedded integral curve of genus $g := H^0(\omega_C)$, then 
$$
\HH^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{g-1}}(m)) \to \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(m));
$$
is  surjective for all $m$; equivalently,
$\HH^{1}_*(\sI_{C/\PP^{g-1}}) = 0$.
\end{theorem}
  
\begin{proof} 
%The Hilbert polynomial $\chi_{C}(t) = h^{0}\sO(t)-\h^{1}\sO(t)$ of $C$ has degree equal to
%$\dim C = 1$, so it is determined by two values.

For $m = 0,1$ the conclusion is immediate. Let $H$ be a general hyperplane in $\PP^{g-1}$, 
and let $\Gamma$ be a set of
 of $g-2$ points of $H\cap C$ (so that the linear span $\overline \Gamma$ is a simple $(g-2)$-secant $(g-3)$-plane).

By induction on $m$ it suffices to prove the surjectivity of
$$
\HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(H)) \otimes \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}((m-1)H)) \to \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(mH))
$$
for all $m$, where $H$ is the hyperplane divisor on $C$. The cases $m=0,1$ are immediate.

Since the points of $\Gamma$
are linearly independent, we may choose homogeneous coordinates $x_{i} \in \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(1))$ so that
$x_{i}(p_{j}) \neq 0$ if and only if $i = j$. 
and $H^0(\sO_C(1))$ is the direct sum of the 2-dimensional
space $V:= \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(H-\Gamma))$ and the space $X := \langle x_1,\dots, x_{g-2}\rangle$ spanned by the $x_i$.
Furthermore, the image of 
$$
V \otimes \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}((m-1)H)) \to \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(mH))
$$
is contained in $\HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(mH-\Gamma))$, which is disjoint from the space
$X_m:= \langle x_1^m,\dots, x_{g-2}^m\rangle$. Since $X_m$ surjects onto
$$
H^0(\sO_C(mH|_\Gamma) = H^0(\sO_C(mH)/H^0(\sO_C(mH(-\Gamma)),
$$
it suffices to prove the surjectivity of
$$
V \otimes \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}((m-1)H)) \to \HH^{0}(\sO_{C}(mH-\Gamma))
$$
for  $m\geq 2$.


Since $V$ is base-point free away from $\Gamma$, the two sections of $V$
define a surjective map $V\otimes \sO_C \to  \sO_{C}(H-\Gamma)$ and thus a short exact sequence of sheaves
$$
(*) \quad 0\to \sL  \to V\otimes \sO_C((m-1)H) \to  \sO_{C}(mH-\Gamma)\to 0
$$
for some invertible sheaf $\sL$. We must show that the right-hand map is surjective on global sections for $m\geq 2$.

From the exact sequence $(*)$ it follows that
$$
\sL\otimes \sO_{C}(mH-\Gamma) \cong  \wedge^2(V\otimes \sO_C((m-1)H) ) \cong \sO_C(2(m-1)H) 
$$
so $\sL \cong \sO_C((m-2)H+\Gamma).$ 


To deal with the case $m=2$ we compute the dimensions of the cohomology of the three sheaves in the exact squence (*).
By the Riemann-Roch theorem,
$$
h^0(\sO_C(2H-\Gamma)) = 3g-3 - (g-2) = 2g-1.
$$ 
On the other hand,
$$
h^0(\sO_C(\Gamma)))=\deg \Gamma -g+1+h^0(H-\Gamma) = -1 + h^0(\sO_C(H-\Gamma)) = 1
$$
and 
$$
\dim V \otimes H^0(\sO_C(H)) = 2g.
$$
Thus the left exact sequence
$$
0\to H^0(\sO_{C}(\Gamma)  \to V\otimes H^0(\sO_C(H)) \to H^0( \sO_{C}(2H-\Gamma))) \to 0
$$
is also right exact, as required for the case $m=2$.

For $m\geq 3$ the divisor $(m-2)H+\Gamma$ has degree $>2g-2$. Consequently
$H^1(\sO_{C}((m-2)H+\Gamma)) = 0$, which implies that the sequence $(*)$ is
exact on global sections, as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{canonical hilbert function}
If $C\subset \PP^{g-1}$ is a canonical curve with a simple $g-2$-secant $g-3$-plane, then the Hilbert function of the homogeneous coordinate ring $S_{C}$ of  $C$ depends only on $g$, and is given by:
$$
\dim({S_{C}})_{n} = h^{0}(\cO_{C}(n)) = 
\begin{cases}
 0 &\mbox {if } d<0\\
 1 & \mbox {if }  d=0\\
 g & \mbox {if }  d=1\\
 (2g-2)n + 1 - g & \mbox {if }  d>1\\
\end{cases}
$$
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{canonical curves are ACM} implies, in particular, that the homogeneous coordinate ring of $C$ can be identified with $\oplus_{n\in \ZZ}\HH^0\sO_C(n)$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}
Though we have stated and proved this theorem for smooth curves,
only a few additional arguments are needed to treat a much more  general case. In \cite{Schreyer} 
the same result is proven for
any purely one-dimensional, nondegenerate closed subscheme $C\subset \PP^{g-1}$ satisfying
$$
 h^{0}(\sO_{C}) = 1,\ h^{0}(\sO_{C}(1) = g, \ \omega_{C} = \sO_{C}(1),
$$ 
and having a simple $(g-2)$-secant $(g-3)$-plane.
\end{fact}
 
 As noted above, the homogeneous coordinate ring $S/I_C$ of an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve $C\subset \PP^r$ is isomorphic
 to $H^0_*(\sO_C)$. In the same way, the canonical module $\omega_{S/I} \cong \Ext_S^{r-1}(S/I_C, S(-r-1))$ of an arithmetically Gorenstein curve satisfies
 $\omega_{S/I} = H^0_*(\omega_C)$.  If the last free module in the minimal resolution of $S/I$ is $S(-a-r-1)$,
 then $\Ext_S^{r-1}(S/I_C, S(-r-1)) = S/I(a)$, and the number $a$ is (unimaginatively) called the $a$-invariant
 of the ring $S/I$. \fix{I'm eternally confused about the sign: should this be $-a$?}
 
 In the case of a canonically embedded curve $C\subset \PP^{g-1}$ we have $\omega_C = \sO_C(1))$, 
 so  $\omega_{S/I}= H^0_*(\omega_C)$ is generated in degree $-1$. Thus the  the last
 free module in the minimal free resolution $\FF$ of $S/I$ is $S(-r-2)$. Since the resolution is minimal,
 the minimal  twist in $F_{i+1}$ must be $\leq$ the minimal twist in $F_i$; since the dual is also a minimal resolution,
 it follows that both the minimal and maximal twists of $F_{i+1}$ are $\leq$ the minimal and maximal twists of $F_i$, respectively.
 Since there are no linear forms in the ideal, and the resolution is self-dual, we see that the betti table of $\FF$ has the form
 \centerline{\scriptsize

\section{Some subvarieties that contain a curve}\label{syzy and geom}

Suppose that $C\subset \PP^r$ is a curve embedded by a complete linear series $|H|$, and that we are given a divisor $D\subset C$ such that $|D| = \{D_\lambda\}$ is a linear series of dimension at least 1. The linear span $\overline D_\lambda$ is the intersection of all the hyperplanes containing $D_\lambda$, and thus has dimension $h^0(\sO_C(H-D_\lambda),$ 
which is independent of $\lambda$. This suggests that the set 
$$
\bigcup_\lambda
$$ 
is an object of dimension $\dim \overline D + r(D) = r-h^0(\sO_C(H-D_\lambda)+r(D)$, and we shall prove that this is
an algebraic variety, defined by the vanishing of $2\times 2$ minors of a certain matrix of linear forms. For example, when
$\overline D$ and $r(D)$ are 1-dimensional, this is a ruled surface of a kind that is easy to understand, and
its free resolution, an Eagon-Northcott complex described below, is termwise a direct summand of the resolution
of the homogeneous coordinate ring of $C$.

To prove these things we proceed more abstractly. Let 
$$
\mu: H^0(\sO_C(D)) \otimes H^0(\sO_C(H-D)) \to H^0(\sO_C(H))
$$
be the multiplication map corresponding to this factorization of $\sO_C(H) = \sO_C(1)$.

\fix{stopped here}
One of the main ways in which syzygies can be seen to reflect the geometry of a scheme $C\subset \PP^r$
depends on the possibility of factoring the line bundle $\sO_C(1)$ as the tensor product of two bundles on $C$
both of which have at least two independent global sections. Suppose for example that $C$ is nondegenerate, 
so that  $\sO_C(1) = \sL_1\otimes \sL_2$. Choose $m\geq 2$ independent global sections
$\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ of  $H^0(\sL_1)$ and $n\geq 2$ independent global sections $\tau_1,\dots, \tau_n$ of $H^0(\sL_2)$. Set
$$
l_{i,j}= \sigma_i\tensor \tau_j \in H^0(\sO_C(1)) = H^0(\sO_{\PP^r}(1))
$$ and consider the matrix 
$$
M = 
\begin{pmatrix}
 l_{1,1}&l_{1,2}&\dots&l_{1,n}\\
 \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
  l_{m,1}&l_{m,2}&\dots&l_{m,n}
\end{pmatrix},
$$
which we think of as an $m\times n$ matrix of linear forms on $\PP^r$.

We claim that  the $2\times 2$ minors $l_{\ell,j} l_{\ell',j'}-l_{\ell,j'} l_{\ell',j}$ are in the homogeneous ideal of $I_C$ of $C$ in $\PP^r$. 
To see this,
let $\kappa$ be the ring of rational functions on $C$. Choosing identifications $\sL_i\otimes \kappa  \cong \kappa $ we see that the $\sigma_i$ and the $\tau_j$ commute with each other as elements of $\kappa  \otimes_{\sO_X} \kappa $, and thus 
$$
\bigl(l_{1,j} l_{2,j'}-l_{1,j'}l_{2,j}\bigr)|_C = \sigma_1\tau_j\sigma_2\tau_j' - \sigma_1\tau_j'\sigma_2\tau_j =0.
$$

\begin{example}
The most familiar example is that of the twisted cubic. In this case the global sections $x_0\dots x_3$ of $\sO_C(1)$ may be identified with the forms $s^3, s^2t, st^2, t^3 \in k[s,t]$, and if $p\in C \cong \PP^1$ then the multiplication of sections
in the factorization  $\sO_C(1) = \sO_C(p) \otimes \sO_C(2p)$ 
$$
\bordermatrix{
 &s^2&st&t^2\cr
 s& s^3&s^2t&st^2\cr
 t& s^2t&st^2&t^3
}
$$
 leads to the familiar matrix
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_0&x_1&x_2\\
x_1&x_2&x_3 
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
We have $I_2(M) = I_C$, and the same idea works for any Veronese or Segre variety (For the rational normal curves see Proposition~\ref{RNC generators}; the more general cases are similar).
\end{example}

In case $C$ is reduced and irreducible the matrix above has a special property: $\kappa $ is a domain, so no product of a nonzero
section of $\sL_1$ with a nonzero section of $\sL_2$ can be zero. We can state this without any reference to $C$:

\begin{definition}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring. A map $M:R^n\to R^m$ is 1-generic if the kernel of the corresponding
 map $R^{n}\otimes R^{m*} \to R$  contains no pure tensor $a\otimes b$. In more concrete terms, a matrix
$M$ is \emph{1-generic} if there are no invertible matrices $A,B$ such that  $AMB$ has some entry equal to 0.
\end{definition}

The case $m=2$, leading to a $2\times m$ matrix is the most interesting, because, as shown in Chapter~\ref{scrolls}, the ideal $I_2(M)$ of a 1-generic matrix of linear forms is the homogeneous ideal of a rational normal 
scroll a variety of of codimension $n-1$ and degree $n$. 
Moreover, the minimal free resolution of $I_2(M)$ has a special form called the 
Eagon-Northcott complex (Theorem~\ref{Eagon-Northcott}), which will appear as a subcomplex of the minimal free resolution of $I_C$. The presence of such a variety containing $C$ or
a subcomplex of this special form in the minimal free resolution of $C$ is thus necessary for the 
factorization of the line bundle $\sO_C(1)$ as above, and it is sometimes sufficient, as well.

\section{The Eagon-Northcott Complex of a $2\times n$ matrix of linear forms}

The Eagon-Northcott complex is a complex of free modules associated to any matrix over any commutative ring. The most familiar special case is the Koszul complex, which one may think of as the Eagon-Northcott complex of a $1\times n$ matrix, and  even in the general case the Eagon-Northcott complex is in a sense built out of the Koszul complexes. A full treatment of this and a whole family of related complexes can be found in 
\cite[Appendix A2]{Eisenbud1995}, and, from a more conceptual and general point of view, in \cite{Weyman-book}. Here we will only
make use of the case of a matrix such as the one above, we will present a simplified account in that case only. Here is the result we need:

\begin{theorem}\label{Eagon-Northcott}
 Let $S = k[x_0,\dots, x_r]$ be a polynomial ring,  and let $M: F\to G$ be a homomorphism with
 $F = S^n(-1), G= S^2$. If $M$ is 1-generic, then the minimal free resolution of $S/I_2(M)$ has the form:
\begin{align*}
EN(M) := 
S \lTo{\bigwedge^2 M} 
 \bigwedge^2 F&
 \lTo^{\delta_{2}}
 S^{2*}\otimes \bigwedge^3 F  \lTo^{\delta_{3}}
  (\Sym^2S^{2})^*\otimes\bigwedge^4F  \\
 &\lTo^{\delta_{4}}\cdots\lTo^{\delta_{n-1}} 
(\Sym^{n-2}S^{2})^*\otimes\bigwedge^nF 
 \lTo 0.
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} We first show that $r\geq n$; more precisely, we show that the span of the entries of $M$ has dimension $\geq n+1$. As noted above, to say that the $2\times n$ matrix of linear forms $M$ is 1-generic means that
the kernel of the corresponding map $ \phi: k^2\otimes k^n \to S_1$ contains no pure tensors. In the projective
space $\PP^{2n-1} = \PP(k^2\otimes k^n)$ the pure tensors form a variety isomorphic to $\PP^1\times \PP^{n-1}$, and thus of dimension $n$. Consequently the kernel of $\phi$ can have dimension at most $n-1$, whence the image of $\phi$ 
in $S_1 = k^{r+1}$ has dimension  $\geq 2n-(n-1) = n+1$. 

We begin the discussion of $EN(M)$ by defining the maps $\delta_i$ and and proving that the given sequence is indeed a complex---that is, consecutive maps compose to 0. For simplicity of notation, we choose a generator of $\wedge^2 S^2$
 and identify it with $S$, which gives a sense to the map labeled $\bigwedge^2M$.
 
  Although it is not hard to do this directly, the dual maps
 $$
 \partial_i: \Sym^{i-2} G \otimes \bigwedge^i F^* \rTo \Sym^{i-1} G \otimes \bigwedge^{i+1} F^*
 $$
 have a more familar-looking description, so we define these instead. Indeed, the map $M$ corresponds to an
 element $\mu\in G\otimes F^*$. We may think of $ \Sym^{i-2} G \otimes \bigwedge^i  F^*$
 as a (bigraded) component of the exterior algebra over $ \Sym G$ of 
 $$
  \Sym G \otimes \bigwedge_S  F^*= \bigwedge_{ \Sym G} (\Sym G \otimes  F^*).
 $$
We define $\partial_i$ to be  multiplication by $\mu$ in the sense of this exterior algebra. Since $\mu$ has degree 1
in this sense, its square is 0. 

To show that $(\bigwedge^2 M)\circ \delta_2$ is zero, it is simplest to choose a matrix representing $M$.
Direct computation using only the usual expansion of a determinant
along a row shows that, up to sign, the
pure basis vector $e\otimes f_i\wedge f_j\wedge f_k$ of $G^*\otimes \bigwedge^3 F$
maps under the composition $(\bigwedge^2) M\circ \delta_2$ to the determinant
of the $3\times 3$ matrix obtained from $M$ by repeating the row corresponding to $e$ and
the columns $i,j,k$. This determinant is 0 because it has a repeated row.

We next prove that if a map $M': F\to G$ is surjective, then the complex of the form $EN(M')$
is split exact.. Such a map $M'$ must split, so
may write $F = G\oplus F'$ in such a way that the map $M': G\oplus F' \to G$ is the projection onto the first factor. 

It will be more convenient to prove the equivalent statement that 
the dual sequence,  
\begin{align*}
EN(M')^* := 
S \rTo{\bigwedge^2 M'^*} 
 \bigwedge^2 F^*&
 \rTo^{\partial_{2}}
 G\otimes \bigwedge^3 F^*  
 \rTo^{\partial_{3}}
  \Sym^2G\otimes\bigwedge^4F^*  \\
 &\rTo^{\partial_{4}}\cdots\rTo^{\partial_{n-1}} 
\Sym^{n-2}G\otimes\bigwedge^nF^* 
 \rTo 0.
\end{align*}
is split exact.

We begin by proving split exactness at  
 $\Sym^{i} G \otimes \bigwedge^{i+2}  F^*$ where $i\geq 1$.
The rank of $G$ is 2, so the module
$ \Sym^{i} G \otimes \bigwedge^{i+2}  F^*$
decomposes as
\begin{align*}
&\Sym^{i} G \otimes \bigwedge^2 G^* \otimes \bigwedge^{i} F'^*\oplus \\
&\Sym^{i} G \otimes  G^*\otimes \bigwedge^{i+1} F'^* \oplus \\
&\Sym^{i} G \otimes  \bigwedge^{i+2} F'^* 
\end{align*}
Note that under our hypothesis, the element $\mu' \in G\otimes F^* = G\otimes G^* \oplus G\otimes F'^*$
has the form $(\mu_G, 0)$, where $\mu_G$ represents the identity map $G \to G$. Thus the complex
$EN(M')^*$ is a direct sum over $i$ of 3-term complexes of the form
%$$
%\Sym^{i+1} G \otimes \bigwedge^2 G^* 
%\lTo^{-\wedge \mu'} 
%\Sym^{i} G \otimes  G^*
%\lTo^{-\wedge \mu'} 
%\Sym^{i-1} G
%$$
$$
\Sym^{i-1} G 
\rTo^{-\wedge \mu'} 
\Sym^{i} G \otimes  G^*
\rTo^{-\wedge \mu'} 
\Sym^{i+1} G \otimes \bigwedge^2 G^* 
$$
tensored with various $\bigwedge^j F'^*$, and it suffices to show that the former are split exact when
$i\geq 0$. Now $\Sym G$ may be identified with $R:= S[x,y]$, where $x,y$ are a basis of $S^2$, and
as such the sequences above may be identified with components of the Koszul complex of $x,y$ over $R$,
%$$
%R\otimes \wedge^2 G\lTo R\otimes G \lTo R .
%$$
$$
0\to R \rTo R\otimes G \rTo R\otimes \wedge^2 G
$$
The only homology of this sequence is $R/(x,y)R$ at the right so if we replace  $R\otimes \wedge^2 G \cong R$ by the ideal $(x,y)R$, this sequence is a split exact sequence of free $S$-modules. This is the desired result.

It remains to treat the beginning of the complex $EN(M')^*$,
$$
S \rTo{\bigwedge^2 M'^*} 
 \bigwedge^2 F^*
 \rTo^{-\wedge \mu'}
G\otimes \bigwedge^3 F^*,
$$
which in our case may be written:
%$$
%\wedge^2 F^* = \bigwedge^2 G^* \oplus (G^*\otimes F'^*) \oplus \bigwedge^2 F'*
%$$
%Consider the pair of maps
\begin{align*}
S \rTo{\bigwedge^2 M'^*} 
 &\bigwedge^2 G^* \ \oplus\ (G^*\otimes F'^*)\ \oplus\ \bigwedge^2 F'^*
 \rTo^{-\wedge \mu'} \\
 &G\otimes \bigwedge^2 G^*\otimes F'^*\ \oplus\ (G\otimes G^*\otimes \bigwedge^2 F'^*)\ \oplus\ G\otimes \bigwedge^3 F'^*
\end{align*}
The map $\bigwedge^2 M'$ is the projection to $\bigwedge^2 G$ composed with the chosen isomorphism
$\bigwedge^2 G \cong S$, and is thus a split monomorphism. To complete the argument, we must show that
 the map marked $-\wedge \mu'$ is a monomorphism on $(G^*\otimes F'^*) \oplus \bigwedge^2 F'^*$.
 But this map is the direct sum of the two maps
  $$
 (G^* \rTo^{-\wedge \mu'} G\otimes \bigwedge^2 G^*)  \otimes F'^*
 $$
 and
 $$
(S  \rTo^{\mu'} G\otimes G^*) \otimes \bigwedge^2 F'^*
 $$
 which are evidently split monomorphisms. 
completing the proof of split exactness of $EN(M')^*$ and thus of $EN(M')$.


To go further we use a basic result, proven in a more general form (and with a slightly different statement) in \cite[Theorem 20.9]{Eisenbud1995}. We make the convention
that the codimension of the empty set is infinity.

\begin{theorem}\label{WMACE}
 Let $S = k[x_0,\dots, x_r]$, and
 $$ 
\FF:  F_0\lTo^{\phi_1}F_1 \lTo \cdots \lTo F_{n-1}\lTo^{\phi_n} F_n\lTo 0
 $$
be a finite complex of free $S$-modules. Set
$$
X_i = \{p\in \AA^{n+1} \mid  H_i(\FF \otimes \kappa(p)) \neq 0\}
$$
The complex $\FF$ is \emph{acyclic} (that is, $H_i(\FF) = 0$ for all $i>0$) if and only if
$$
\codim X_i \geq i
$$
for all $i>0$. Moreover, $X_{0}\supseteq X_{1}\supseteq \cdots \supseteq X_{n}$
\qed
\end{theorem}

For example, Nakayama's Lemma implies that $X_{0}$ is the support of $\coker \phi_{1}$; thus $X_{0}$ is the set defined by the $\rank F_{0}$-sized minors of $\phi_{1}$. Similarly, 
$X_{n}$ is the support of the cokernel of the dual of $\phi_{n}$. 

A familiar case occurs when  $n=1$. In this case the theorem says that a map $F_1\to F_0$ is a monomorphism iff it becomes a monomorphism after tensoring with the field of rational functions $K$, which follows from the flatness of
localization and the fact that $F_1$ is torsion-free, so that
$F_1 \subset F_1 \otimes K$. 

\begin{fact}
Theorem~\ref{WMACE} is true in this form over any Cohen-Macaulay ring; for more general
rings, ``codimension'' must be replaced by ``grade'', as in the given reference.
The Theorem can be generalized
to case where the $F_i$ are not free, but are sufficiently ``like'' free modules, too.
\end{fact}

Conclusion of the proof of Theorem~\ref{Eagon-Northcott}.
Let $X_{i}\subset \AA^{r+1}$ be the variety defined from the complex $EN(M)$ as in 
Theorem~\ref{WMACE}. Since $EN(M)$ becomes split exact after inverting any $2\times 2$ minor of $M$
$X_{i}$ is
contained in the closed set defined by $I_{2}(M)$, for all $i$. Thus if $I_{2}(M)$ has codimension $n-1$,
then $EN(M)$ is acyclic. 
\end {proof}

%\fix{START COMMENTED OUT MATERIAL}
%We will also use a special case of the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula connecting projective dimension and depth:
%
%\begin{theorem}\label{Auslander-Buchsbaum}
%If $R$ is a regular local ring of dimension $d$, and $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, then the projective dimension of $M$ is $\leq d$ with equality only if
%$M$ contains a submodule of finite length. 
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{corollary}\label{associated primes}
%If $R$ is a regular local ring of dimension $d$, and $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, then the codimension of an associated prime of $A$ is at most the projective dimension of $A$. 
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof}[Proof of  Corollary~\ref{associated primes}]
% Projective dimension can only decrease under localization, and
% the associated primes $P$ of $A$ are those for which $A_{P}$ contains a submodule
% of finite length.
%\end{proof}
%
%With this and the multi-linear algebra above we can  prove the basic acyclicity result for an Eagon-Northcott complex:
%
%\fix{the Theorem as now stated doesn't need the following. I've copied the short proof
%of acyclicity into the end of the proof above.}
%\begin{proposition}\label{acyclicity}
%Let $S = k[x_0,\dots, x_r]$ be a polynomial ring,  and let $M: F\to G$ be a homomorphism with
% $F = S^n(-1), G= S^2$.
% $$
% S^n \cong F \rTo^M G \cong S^2
% $$
% is a (not necessarily homogeneous) map of free $S$-modules.
% The Eagon-Northcott complex $EN(M)$ is acyclic if and only if $\codim I_2(M) \geq n-1$, in which case the dual complex is also acyclic and
% the associated primes of $I_2(M)$ are all minimal and of codimension $n-1$.
% \end{proposition}
%
%\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{acyclicity}]
%Let $X_{i}\subset \AA^{r+1}$ be the variety defined from the complex $EN(M)$ as in 
%Theorem~\ref{WMACE}. Since $EN(M)$ becomes split exact after inverting any $2\times 2$ minor of $M$
%$X_{i}$ is
%contained in the closed set defined by $I_{2}(M)$, for all $i$. Thus if $I_{2}(M)$ has codimension $n-1$,
%then $EN(M)$ is acyclic. 
%
%In this case the projective dimension
%of $S/I_{2}(M)$ is $n-1$, so all the associated primes of $I_{2}(M)$ have codimension
%exactly $n-1$.
%
%If $EN(M)$ is  acylic then, by Theorem~\ref{WMACE}, the codimension of $X_{n-1}$ is at least $n-1$. Thus to prove that the acyclicity of $EN(M)$ implies  $\codim I_{2}(M) \geq n-1$ (and thus
%$\codim I_{2}(M))  n-1$, it suffices to show that $X_{n-1} = X_{0}$ as algebraic sets.
%
%To see this, note that
%the ideal of $2\times 2$ minors of $M$. By definition, $X_{n-1}$ 
%is the set of points $p$ where $\kappa(p)\otimes \delta_{n-1}$ is not an inclusion, 
%or equivalently, that 
%that 
%$$
%\kappa(p)\otimes F\otimes \Sym^{n-3}G 
%\cong 
%\kappa(p)\otimes \bigwedge^{n-1} F^{*} \otimes  \Sym^{n-3}G 
%\rTo^{\partial_{n-1}}
%\kappa(p)\otimes \bigwedge^{n} F^{*} \otimes  \Sym^{n-2}G
%\cong
%\kappa(p)\otimes \Sym^{n-2}G
%$$
%is not a split surjection, and it is easy to see that the composite map takes
%$a\otimes b$ to $\kappa(p) \otimes M(a)\cdot b$, so the cokernel is the $(n-2)$-nd symmetric power
%of the cokernel of the map $\kappa(p) \otimes M$. Thus $X_{n}$ is equal to the support
%of the cokernel of $M$ itself. 
%
%By Nakayama's Lemma, $X_{0}$ is the support of $M$; furthermore, the localization of $\coker M$ at $p$ is 0 if and only if
%one of the 
%$2\times 2$ minors of $M$ is a unit locally at $p$ so $X_{0}$, so this is defined
%set-theoretically by $I_{2}(M)$.
%
%It now follows from Theorem~\ref{WMACE} that all the $X_{i}$ are equal, so $EN(M)$ is 
%acyclic if and only if $EN(M)^{*}$ is acyclic. 
%
%Since $M$ is 1-generic the entries of of the second row of $M$ are linearly independent, and since the dimension of the span of all the linear forms is at least $n+1$, some element in the first row is outside the span of the the elements in the second. After a permutation of columns we may assume that $l_{1,1}, l_{2,1}, l_{2,2},\dots l_{2,n}$ are linearly independent, and we may take them to be a subset of the variables, say $x_{0},\dots x_{n+1}$
%
%We next show by induction on $n$ that  $I_{2}(M)$ is prime. In the case $n=2$ we have $I_{2}(M) =  (x_{0}x_{2}-x_{1}l_{1,2})$ which obviously does not factor. 
%
%Now suppose that $n>2$, and let $M'$ be the matrix $M$ with the first column omitted. we know by induction that $I_{2}(M')$ is prime of codimension $n-2$. Since $I:=I_{2}(M)$ does not have the maximal ideal as an associated prime, it is saturated. The ideal $I_{2}(M)+x_{0}$ properly contains $I_{2}(M')$ and thus has codimension $\geq n-1$ in $S/x_{0}$, whence we see that every component of $I_{2}(M)$ meets the open set
%$x_{0} = 1$. Restricting to this open set \fix{complete the proof}
%\end{proof}
%
%The first non-trivial example of a finite free resolution is the Koszul complex on 3 variables, which is the minimal $S = k[x,y,z]$-free resolution of the module $S/(x,y,z)$:
%$$

\section{How to look at a resolution}
In this section we collect some definitions and results from \cite{Eisenbud1995} that will help to understand the exposition of Green's conjecture, which occupies the last section of this chapter.

If $N$ is a finitely generated graded module over $S = \CC[x_0,\dots, x_r]$, then there is a minimal graded free resolution $\FF$
of $N$ that we can write in the form
$$
0\lTo N \lTo^\epsilon \oplus_jS(-j)^{\beta_{0,j}} \lTo^{\phi_1} \cdots \lTo^{\phi_t}\oplus_jS(-j)^{\beta_{t,j}}\lTo 0,
$$
where it is understood that each direct sum has only finitely many nonzero terms.
To construct this, suppose that a minimal homogeneous set of generators of $N$
contains $\beta_{1,j}$ generators of degree $j$ for each $j$; this defines a degree 0 map $\epsilon$
from 
$
\oplus_jS(-j)^{\beta_{0,j}}
$
onto $N$. We proceed similarly with the kernel of $\epsilon$, and continue to construct the whole resolution.
Hilbert's syzygy theorem \cite[***]{Eisenbud1995} implies that the process ends after $t\leq n$ steps with a map $\phi_t$ whose
kernel is 0. The number $t$ is then the projective dimension of $N$. It follows from the Auslander-Buchsbaum
theorem~\cite[***]{Eisenbud1995} that $t \geq \codim \ann_S(N)$, the codimension of the support of $N$.

Since we choose a minimal set of generators at each stage, the matrices of the $\phi_i$ have entries in the maximal
ideal $(x_0,\dots x_r)$, and thus each $\beta_{i+1, j}$ must be strictly greater than some $\beta_{i,j}$. For this reason it
is more convenient to tabulate the numbers so that $\beta_{i,j}$ is in the $i$-th column and $j-i$-th row:

$$
\scriptsize{
\begin{matrix} 
j\backslash i&\vline&0   &  1    & \cdots & n    \cr\hline

       0&\vline&\beta_{0,0}&\beta_{1,1}&\cdots&\beta_{n,n}\cr

%
For example the Koszul complex that resolves the homogeneous coordinate ring $S/(Q, F_1, F_2)$ of the complete intersection of  2 quadrics and  and a cubic in $\PP^3$ has the form
$$
S \lTo S(-2)\oplus S(-3)^2 \lTo S(-5)^2\oplus S(-6) \lTo S(-8) \lTo 0,
$$
which has betti table:

a $2\times n$ matrix has betti table

\section{Green's Conjecture}


Corollary~\ref{canonical hilbert function} implies that the dimension of the vector space of forms of degree $d$
vanishing on a canonical curve is independent of the curve; for example, for $d=2$ we get
$
\dim ({I_{C}})_{2} = {g-2\choose 2}
$
The next question one might ask is whether or not $I_{C}$, is generated by $(I_{C})_{2}$ and (much) more generally, what is the 
Betti table of the homogeneous coordinate ring of $C$.

 For example,
when $C$ is trigonal then by the geometric Riemann-Roch theorem, $C$ has a 1-dimensional family of trisecant lines; any quadric containing $C$ must contain all these. As we have seen in Chapter~\ref{ScrollsChapter}, these lines sweep
out a 2-dimensional scroll defined by the $2\times g-2$ matrix corresponding to the decompostion of $\sO_C(1)$
into a tensor product of the $g^{1}_{3}$ defined by a line bundle $\sL$, the complementary linear series,
defined by $\omega_{C}\otimes \sL^{-1}$ has $g-2$ sections, and we see from Theorem ****
that the scroll itself lies on the ${g-2\choose 2}$ quadrics defined by the minors of a $2\times g-2$, 1-generic matrix of linear forms. The exactness of the Eagon-Northcott complex associated to this matrix shows that there are no relations of degree 0 on these minors -- that is, they are linearly independent over the ground field. It follows that they generate the vector space of all quadrics containing $C$. But by **** the locus defined by
the ideal of minors is a rational normal scroll of dimension 2, and thus the minors cannot generate $I_{C}$.

Furthermore, if $g = 6$ and $C$ is isomorphic to a plane quintic curve, then the canonical series of the plane quintic is $5-3 = 2$ times the hyperplane series, and it follows that the canonical image of $C$ lies on the Veronese surface in $\PP^{5}$. Using Theorem *** again, we see that the Veronese is contained in (in fact, equal to) the intersection of the quadrics defined by the $2\times 2$ minors of a generic symmetric matrix, coming from the 
multiplication map 
$$
\HH^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{1}}(1))\otimes \HH^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{1}}(1)) \to \HH^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{1}}(2)) = \HH^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{5}}(1))
$$
and there are $6 = {g-2\choose 2}$ independent quadrics in this ideal. Again in this case, they cannot generate the ideal of the curve.

One might fear that this is the beginning of some long series of examples, but in fact it is not: 

\begin{theorem} [Petri]
The ideal of a canonical curve of genus $\geq 5$ is generated by the $\g-2\choose 2$-dimensional space of quadrics it contains unless the curve is either trigonal or isomorphic to a plane quintic; in the latter cases, the ideal of the curve is generated by quadrics and cubics.
\end{theorem}

For a modern treatment of Petri's Theorem in this level of generality see \cite{Schreyer}; for a different treatment see \cite{Arbarello-Sernesi}.

The two exceptions can be described simultaneously by using the Clifford index:

\begin{definition}
 The Clifford index Cliff $\sL$ of a line bundle $\sL$ on a curve $C$ is $d-2r$, where $d := \deg \sL$ and $r :=  h^0(\sL)-1$. The Clifford index Cliff $C$ of
 a curve $C$ of genus $\geq 2$ is the minimum of the Clifford indices of special line bundles with at least 2 sections.
\end{definition}

Cliffords Theorem \ref{****} says that Cliff $C \geq 0$, and that Cliff $C = 0$ if and only if $C$ is hyperelliptic. If $C$ is not hyperelliptic, then it turns out that Cliff $C=1$ if and only if $C$ is either trigonal or isomorphic to a plane quintic. The Clifford index of any smooth curve of genus $g\geq 2$ is $\leq \lceil g/2\rceil+1$, with equality for a general curve, as one sees from the Brill-Noether Theorem~\ref{}, and for ``most'' curves the line bundle $\sL$ of maximal Clifford index has only 2 sections, though there is an infinite sequence of examples where this
``Clifford dimension'' is greater.

Moving to cubic forms, we see that $\dim ({I_C})_3 = {g+2\choose 3}-(5g-5)$. Comparing this number with the number of (possibly linearly dependent)
cubics obtained by multiplying $g$ linear forms and ${g-2\choose 2}$ quadrics, we see that the ideal of the curve has at least
$$
{g-2\choose 2} - {g+2\choose 3}-(5g-5) 
$$
independent syzygies of total degree 3 (that is, linear syzygies on the quadrics. For example when $g=4$ so that $C\subset \PP^3$ there is one quadric and 5 independent
cubics, at most 4 of which are multiples of the quadric. Since the curve has degree $6 = 2\times 3$, the ideal of the curve must be generated by
the quadric and one cubic. When $g=5$ there are genuinely two possibilities: the three quadrics in the ideal might be a complete intersection
(then they generate the ideal), so the Betti table would be

\centerline{\small %\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{r|ccc} 
$j\backslash i$&0&1&2\\ 
\hline 
0&1&$-$&$-$\\ 
1&$-$&2&$-$\\ 
2&$-$&$-$&$1$\\ 
\end{tabular}}

\noindent or the curve could be trigonal, in which case the 3 quadrics generate the ideal of a surface scroll $F$. In the latter
case, the Eagon-Northcott complex resolves the homogeneous coordinate  ring  $S_F$ of the scroll,
$$
0\to S^2(-3) \to S^3(-2) \to S \to S_F \to 0
$$
which has Betti table

\centerline{\small %\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{r|ccc} 
$j\backslash i$&0&1&2\\ 
\hline 
0&1&$-$&$-$\\ 
1&$-$&3&$2$\\ 
\end{tabular}}
\noindent and we see that there are 2 linear relations among the quadrics. Thus the minimal generators of $I_C$ must include exactly 2 cubics as well as the 3 quadrics. Since the homogeneous ring of a canonical curve is Gorenstein, its minimal free resolution is symmetric, and this is enough for us to fill in its Betti table:

\centerline{\small %\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{r|cccc} 
$j\backslash i$&0&1&2&3\\ 
\hline 
0&1&$-$&$-$&$-$\\ 
1&$-$&3&$2$&$-$\\ 
2&$-$&$2$&$3$&$-$\\ 
3&$-$&$-$&$-$&$1$\\ 
\end{tabular}}
\noindent Note that we can ``see'' the scroll reflected in the top two lines of the table.

From the analogue of the Hilbert-Burch Theorem for Gorenstein rings of codimension 3 one can show that the 5 generators can be written as the 
pfaffians of a skew symmetric $5\times 5$ matrix whose entries are of degrees 1 and 2, in the following pattern (we give just the degrees, and put - in the places that are 0):
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
 -&-&1&1&1\\
-&-&1&1&1\\
1&1&-&2&2\\
1&1&2&-&2\\
1&1&2&2&-
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Here the $2\times 2$ minors of the upper $2\times 3$ block of linear forms generate the ideal of the scroll. 

Applying this logic more generally we get the following result about the canonical embedding of curves with low degree maps to $\PP^1$:

\begin{theorem}
 Let $C\subset \PP^{g-1}$ be a reduced, irreducible canonical curve. If $C$ has a line bundle $\sL$ of degree $d$ with $h^0(\sL) = 2$  then
 there is a 1-generic  $2\times (g+1-d)$ matrix of linear forms whose minors define a scroll of codimension $g-d$ containing $C$; and thus an
 Eagon-Northcott complex of length $g-d$ is a quotient complex of the minimal free resolution of $S_C$. In particular, the Betti table of $S_C$ is
 termwise $\geq$ that of the homogeneous coordinate ring of the scroll.
 \end{theorem}
 
 Thus the existence of the $g^1_d$ on $C$, together with the symmetry of the resolution of the Gorenstein ring $S_C$,
  implies that the Betti table of $S_C$ has the form
 
 \centerline{\small %\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{r|cccccccccccc} 
$j\backslash i$&0&1&2&\dots&d-3&d-2&\dots&g-d-1&g-d&\dots&g-3&g-2\\ 
\hline 
0&1&$-$&$-$&$\cdots$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\ 
1&$-$&*&*&$\cdots$&*&*&$\cdots$&*&$?$&$\cdots$&?&?\\ 
2&$-$&?&?&$\cdots$&?&*&$\cdots$&*&*&$\cdots$&*&*\\ 
3&$-$&$-$&$-$&$\cdots$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&1
\end{tabular}}
\noindent where we have assumed for illustration that $d-2<g-d-1$. The places marked $-$ are definitely 0 and those marked * are definitely nonzero. The rows marked 0 and 1 contain the Betti table of the scroll.

We can summarize this by saying
that if the curve $C$ has a line bundle $\sL$ of degree $d$ with exactly 2 sections, and thus of Clifford index $c = d-2$ the row labeled  2 
in the Betti diagram definitely has nonzero entries starting in the $c$-th place. As with the case of the plane quintics, above, one can
make a similar argument for \emph{any} line bundle of Clifford index $c$

Starting from such examples, Mark Green made a bold conjecture that is still open as of this writing:

\begin{conjecture}[Green's Conjecture]
If $C$ is a smooth canonical curve of genus g and Clifford index d-2, then the entries marked with ? in the Betti table above are all 0. 
\end{conjecture}

The conjecture was made for curves over a field of characteristic 0, and is known in many cases, though it is also known to fail in small finite characteristics.
In \cite{MR1941089} and \cite{MR2157134} the conjecture was proven for generic curves of each Clifford index.  See~\cite{MR4022070} for the currently simplest
proof. The conjecture is also is known for plane curves, and in a number of other special cases. 

\subsection{Low genus canonical embeddings} 
In his 1983 Brandeis thesis, Frank Schreyer analyzed all the possibilities for resolutions of smooth canonical curves up to genus 8; the results are summarized in the table below, taken from the published version \cite{Schreyer-canonical} of the thesis.

different; and the hyperelliptic cases are included. Maybe retype in normal notation?}
