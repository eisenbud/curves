\chapter{Interlude on Moduli}
\label{Moduli chapter}

At this point (wherever it turns out to be) we should have a discussion of the whole notion of moduli and parameter spaces in algebraic geometry.

Briefly: it is a fundamental aspect of algebraic geometry that the objects we deal with often vary in families, and can often be parametrized by a ``universal" such family. Among the objects we'll be dealing with here, and to which this applies, are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item effective divisors of a given degree $d$ on a given smooth, projective curve $C$;

\item line bundles of a given degree $d$ on a given smooth, projective curve $C$;

\item smooth, projective curves $C$ of a given genus $g$; and

\item smooth, projective curves $C \subset \PP^r$ of degree $d$.
\end{enumerate}

In this discussion, we'll describe each of these, indicating their characterization as a moduli space, and (where known) basic properties such as irreducibility and dimension (and non-emptiness!).

\section{Families}

Central to the characterization of a moduli space is the notion of a \emph{family} of the objects parametrized. Let's start with the example (3) above. By a moduli space for smooth, projective curves of genus $g$, we would naively mean a variety whose points are in natural one-to-one correspondence with the set of isomorphism classes of such curves.

The issue here, as it so often is,  is the word ``natural." If we're working over $\CC$, for example, all positive dimensional varieties have the same cardinality ($\aleph_1$), so saying that we have a bijection between the points of a variety $M$ and the set of isomorphism classes of curves doesn't characterize $M$. Rather, we need some basic condition on the bijection, for which the word ``natural" is a stand-in. Key to this is the notion of a ``family" of the objects involved. We'll describe this first in the present setting of smooth, projective curves $C$ of a given genus $g$, and then go on to consider the other examples above. 

The definition is straightforward: by a family of smooth, projective curves $C$ of a given genus $g$ over a given base variety $B$, we mean a flat morphism
$\cC \to B$ whose fibers are smooth, projective curves $C$ of genus $g$

In Chapter~\ref{new Jacobians chapter}, we saw how to parametrize the set of line bundles of degree $d$ on a given curve $C$ by the points of an algebraic variety, the \emph{Picard variety} $\Pic^d(C)$. The theory of  Jacobians of curves is an enormously rich and deep one, but leaving all that aside, just the existence of a parameter space makes a big difference: it allows us, for example, to use dimension estimates to prove theorems like Theorem~\ref{g+3 theorem}, and will allow us to give a much stronger version of the Brill-Noether theorem in Section~\ref{BNomnibus} below.

In fact, parameter space are ubiquitous in algebraic geometry. The fact that under reasonable circumstances the set of objects of a given type---schemes, sheaves on a scheme, morphisms between schemes---may be put naturally in one-to-one correspondence with the points of a variety is one of the most essential characteristics of the subject.

In this chapter, we'll introduce some of the basic parameter spaces relevant to algebraic curves. We won't actually construct any of them---God forbid!---but we'll indicate basic facts about each.
