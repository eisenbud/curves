\chapter{Moduli} 
\label{Moduli chapter}\label{ModuliChapter}

Here's a possible new structure for the chapter. Possible too ambitious. But some items below could be quite short. Can we prove *anything*? Severi varieties move back home to "Plane curves". Hurwitz and Hurwitz numbers should go into the Hyperelliptic chapter, where we have a section on coverings of $\PP^1$ already.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Name: let's call it ``parameter spaces and moduli''.
 
 Introduction: what we want of moduli (replacing "what is a moduli problem"). Three routes
 1. Get lucky, and find a moduli space readymade (eg: Jacobian). 2.  gather all examples in one place, factor out isomorphisms (we did this with divisors). 3. Get local deformation info, patch.
 
 \item Gathering all examples:  the Hilbert scheme, with it's family. Note that every variety appears many times (GL(n)). Talk briefly about construction: universal bound for regularity of ideals with given saturation and/or Gotzmann's persistence theorem (if an ideal generated in degree $\leq d$ achieves minimal growth
 from degree $d$ to degree $d+1$, it has minimal growth (and thus known Hilbert function) thereafter.
 Use this to give determinantal equations.
 
 \item versal deformation explain why not universal deformation.
 
 \item The moduli space. Approach \#1 (Mumford's Thesis, GIT, then--for the compactification, projectiveness, Mumford-Kundsen and Knudsen) Explain Hilbert scheme of tricanonical curves, linearize the action of PGL, take quotient. Fibers are NOT the orbits (unlike case of finite groups). Stable, semistable, unstable. 
 
 \item Interlude: Semistable reduction. ``every degeneration of curves is a degeneration to a nodal curve''
(mention open problems). The reason why the compactification is compact.

\item The moduli space. Approach \#2 (Deligne-Mumford)

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Can one write down a general curve of genus $g$?}

%The first important result about the moduli space is that $M_g$ is irreducible; we will sketch the characteristic 0 proof in Section~\ref{hurwitz spaces}  (a proof of the irreducibility of $M_g$ valid in arbitrary characteristic was not found until much later. \fix{reference!})

Given that a moduli space $M_g$ exists and is irreducible, we can make sense of the question: Can one write down a general curve of genus $g$?
That is: can we find a family of curves depending freely on parameters---in other words, a family $\cC \to B$ over an open subset $B \subset \AA^n$---that includes a general curve of genus $g$, in the sense that the induced map $\phi_\cC : B \to M_g$ is dominant? This is of course just the first step in knowing the structure of $M_g$.

We have done this in the case of genus 2 and 3. Essentially
the same approach works in genera $4$ and $5$; in each case a general canonical curve is a complete intersection, so that if we take the coefficients of its defining polynomials to be general scalars we have a general curve.

This method breaks down when we get to genus 6, where a canonical curve is not a complete intersection. But it's close enough: a general canonical curve of genus 6 is the intersection of a smooth del Pezzo surface $S \subset \PP^5$ with a quadric hypersurface $Q$; since all smooth del Pezzo surfaces in $\PP^5$ are isomorphic, we can just fix one such surface $S$ and let $Q$ be a general quadric.

It gets harder as the genus increases. Let's do one more case, genus 7, which already calls for a different approach. Here we want to argue that, by Brill-Noether theory, a general curve of genus $7$ can be realized as (the normalization of) a plane septic curve with 8 nodes $p_1,\dots,p_8 \in \PP^2$. Equivalently, if we let $S = Bl_{p_1,\dots,p_8}(\PP^2)$ be the blow-up, and let $l$ and $e_1,\dots,e_8$ be the classes of the pullback of a line and of the eight exceptional divisors respectively, a divisor of class $7l - 2 \sum e_i$ is a curve of genus 7 on $S$. Thus the curves on $S$ form a linear series, parametrized by a projective space $\PP^{11}$.

The problem is, there are many such surfaces $S$; we don't have a single linear system that includes the general curve of genus 7. The good news is, that's OK because the surfaces $S$ themselves form a rationally parametrized family. Explicitly, if we look at the set $\Phi$ of pairs $(S, C)$ with $S = Bl_{p_1,\dots,p_8}(\PP^2)$  the blow-up of $\PP^2$ at eight points and $C \subset S$ a curve of class $7l - 2 \sum e_i$ on $S$, then $\Phi$ is a $\PP^{11}$-bundle over $(\PP^2)^8$, and so is again a rational variety; choosing a rational parametrization of $\Phi$ we get a family of curves of genus $7$ parametrized by $\PP^{27}$ and dominating $M_7$. As before, then, a general point in $\PP^{27}$ yields a general curve of genus 7.

Things continued in this vein up through genus 10, but then this approach fails as well: if we represent a general curve of genus 11 as a plane curve with nodes, the nodes are no longer general points of $\PP^2$, and the same argument doesn't work. Ad hoc (and much more difficult) arguments were given in genera 11, 12 13 and 14, but so far no-one can go further in producing general curves. 

A spectacular application of the existence of $\overline M_g$ was the proof that this sequence cannot go much further! To say that there exists a family $\cC \to B$ over an open subset $B \subset \AA^n$ such that the induced map $\phi_\cC : B \to M_g$ is dominant implies that $M_g$ is \emph{unirational}, an assertion that we can disprove simply by exhibiting a pluricanonical divisor on a desingularization of $\overline M_g$. This was carried out in \fix{add references)} for all genera $g \geq 23$; in a neat twist, the divisor used consisted of curves possessing a special linear system with Brill-Noether number $-1$, meaning its existence was dependent on the proof of the Brill-Noether Theorem.

The existence of an effective pluricanonical divisor on $\overline M_g$ tells us even more: for example it implies that \emph{$M_g$ is not uniruled}, meaning that through a general point $[C] \in M_g$ there are no rational curves. This is because the restriction (or pullback) of a nonzero differential to such a curve would be a nonzero diferential, contradicting the fact that the canonical bundle of $\PP^1$ has  negative degree. A consequence is that the sort of descriptions of embeddings with which much of this book is concerned, where we produce a surface on which a general curve of a certain sort lies, cannot be continued to high genus:

\begin{corollary}
 A general curve $C$ of  genus $\geq 22$ does not lie in a nontrivial linear series on any surface
 except those birational to $C\times \PP^1$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
 A linear family of curves containing $C$ that are not all isomorphic would map to a rational curve in $M_g$; if the curves are all isomorphic, one can show that the family
 covers a surface birational to a product of $C$ and some other curve \fix{put in an argument,
 using the prop. that a general curve has no automorphisms.}
\end{proof}



\begin{exercise}
Find the degree of the covering space $\alpha : \cH_{3,g} \to U \subset \PP^{2g+4}$
defined in Section{hurwitz spaces}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{symmetric power vs Hilbert scheme}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If $X$ is a smooth curve, then the Hilbert scheme of finite subschemes of $X$ of degree $d$ is
 isomorphic to the symmetric product of $d$ copies of $X$.
 \item If $X$ is a singular curve or any variety of dimension $r \geq 2$, the symmetric power $X^{(d)}$ is \emph{not} the Hilbert scheme of subschemes of dimension 0 and degree $d$ on $X$. 
 
 \fix{maybe needs a hint, especially since we can't do even the first part!}
\end{enumerate}
 \end{exercise}

\section{Exercises}
\begin{exercise}
It is not an accident that we can characterize a fine moduli space $M$ in terms of the maps into it. 
 Let $X$ be a category, and $F,G$ two functors from $X$ to the category of sets.
 A morphism $\eta: F\to G$ in the category of functors is what is called a \emph{natural transformation}:
 for every object $a\in X$ there is a morphism $\eta_a:F(a) \to G(a)$ such that for every
 morphism $f: a\to b$ in $X$ the compositions $G(f)\circ \eta_a$ and $\eta_b\circ F(f)$
 are equal. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item (Prove Yoneda's Lemma: If $X$ is any category, and $F$ is a contravariant functor from $X$ to the category of sets, then 
 $$
 \Hom_{\hbox{\scriptsize Functors on $X$}}(\Hom_X( -, Z), F) = F(Z)
 $$
 \item Conclude that if the functors $\Hom_X( -, Z)$ and $Hom_X( -, Z')$ are isomorphic in the functor category, 
 then $Z \cong Z'$ in $X$; that is, the functor $\Hom_X( -, Z)$ determines the object $Z$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

%\section{Unirationality}
%
%The Brill-Noether theorem, in all its many forms, deals with a simple question: what linear series $g^r_d$ does a curve $C$ of genus $g$ possess? Of course, the answer depends on $C$, but we know from general principles that it's constant on an open subset of $M_g$; so it's natural to ask what the answer is on that open set. That is the subject of the Brill-Noether theorem: what linear series exist on a general curve $C$ of genus $g$? This raises, naturally, a question we'll take up next.
%
%\subsection{Can we write down a general curve of genus $g$?}
%
%Let's do this one genus at a time. For curves of genus 2, the family of curves given by
%$$
%y^2 = x^6 + a_5x^5 + \dots + a_1x + a_0
%$$
%includes every curve of genus $2$; in other words, the induced (rational) map $\AA^6 \to M_2$ is dominant, so that  a general choice of the coefficients $a_i$ will yield a general curve.
