\chapter*{Preface}
\label{preface}


In writing this book we have been keenly aware of  the influence on us of 
our great teachers in this subject,
Phillip Griffiths, David Mumford, David Buchsbaum and Antonius van de Ven. Great sylists
as well as great mathematicians, we can only hope that, consciously or not, the reader will occasionally hear their voices in our writing. 

We have  taught large parts of this material
at Harvard and Berkeley, and our students contributions to whatever virtues our text may have
are considerable. Izzet Coscun, in particular, read an earlier version of this manuscript in detail, and made myriad useful comments. 

We have had the good fortune to have, in the
role of copy-editor, a mathematician and friend, Silvio Levy, whose sense of style and publishing expertise informs the
layout of this book. Silvio also converted our sketches, done (to quote James Thurber) with a dull
pencil, into professional graphics that are often mathematically accurate.

Writing this book was an enterprise of years that involved the patience of more than just the authors, and we have been fortunate to have had the support of Monika and Vicky, wives who understand and value our work during the hours ``away'' that are necessary.

To all these, our heartfelt thanks!

David and Joe, August, 2024
