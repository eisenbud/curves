\chapter{Interlude on Moduli}
\label{ModuliInterlude}

In the last chapter, we saw how to parametrize the set of line bundles of degree $d$ on a given curve $C$ by the points of an algebraic variety, the \emph{Picard variety} $\Pic^d(C)$. The theory of  Jacobians of curves is an enormously rich and deep one, but leaving all that aside, just the existence of a parameter space makes a big difference: it allows us, for example, to use dimension estimates to prove theorems like Theorem~\ref{g+3 theorem}, and will allow us to give a much stronger version of the Brill-Noether theorem in Section~\ref{BNomnibus} below.

In fact, parameter space are ubiquitous in algebraic geometry. The fact that under reasonable circumstances the set of objects of a given type---schemes, sheaves on a scheme, morphisms between schemes---may be put naturally in one-to-one correspondence with the points of a variety is one of the most essential characteristics of the subject.

In this chapter, we'll introduce some of the basic parameter spaces relevant to algebraic curves. We won't actually construct any of them---God forbid!---but we'll indicate basic facts about each.
