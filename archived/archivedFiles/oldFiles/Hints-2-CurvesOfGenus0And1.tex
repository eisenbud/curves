\chapter{RR exercises}\label{RR exercises}


In the following series of exercises, we are going to be working with smooth projective curves associated to a given affine curve $C^\circ := V(f(x,y)) \subset \AA^2$; this is the unique smooth projective curve containing the normalization of $C^\circ$ as a Zariski dense open subset.

\begin{exercise}
Let $C$ be the smooth projective curve associated to the affine plane curve $y^3+x^3 = 1$, and let $\pi : C \to \PP^1$ be the map given by the rational function $x$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the branch points and ramification points of $\pi$, and deduce that the genus of $C$ is 1.
\item For any two points $p, q \in C$ find the complete linear series $|p+q|$.
\item Find the (unique) map $\eta : C \to \PP^1$ of degree 2 such that $\eta((1,0)) = \eta((0,1))$, and determine the ramification points of $\eta$.
\item Show that $C$ is isomorphic to the smooth projective curve associated to the affine plane curve $y^2 +x^3 = 1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

For the next three exercises, let $C^\circ$ be the affine plane curve given as the zero locus of $y^2 - x^6 +1$, and let $C$ be the corresponding smooth projective curve. Note that the map $C^\circ \to \AA^1$ given by the projection $(x,y) \mapsto x$ extends to a map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$, expressing $C$ as a 2-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ branched over the points $1, \zeta, \dots, \zeta^5$, where $\zeta$ is any primitive 6th root of unity. Let $r_\alpha$ be the point $(\zeta^\alpha, 0) \in C^\circ \subset C$, and  let $p$ and $q \in C$ be the two points lying over the point $\infty \in \PP^1$.

\begin{exercise}\label{hyperelliptic curve 1}
Let $C^\circ$ be the affine plane curve given as the zero locus of $y^2 - x^6 +1$, and let $C$ be the corresponding smooth projective curve. 

Show  that the map $C^\circ \to \AA^1$ given by the projection $(x,y) \mapsto x$ extends to a map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$, expressing $C$ as a 2-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ branched over the points $1, \zeta, \dots, \zeta^5$, where $\zeta$ is any primitive 6th root of unity. Show that there are two distinct points $p$ and $q \in C$  lying over the point $\infty \in \PP^1$,
so that $C$ is unramified over $\infty$.

What is the genus of $C$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} With $C$ as in Exercise~\ref{hyperelliptic curve 1}:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $r_\alpha$ be the branch point over $\zeta^\alpha$. Show that
$$
p+q \sim 2r_\alpha \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{\alpha = 0}^5 r_\alpha \sim 3p+3q.
$$

\item Find the vector space $H^0(\cO_C(D))$ where $D = r_0 + r_2 + r_4$, and find the (unique) divisor $E$ on $C$ such that $E + r_1 \sim r_0 + r_2 + r_4$.

\end{enumerate}

Hint: for the first part, consider the divisors of the rational functions $x-\zeta^\alpha$ and $y$. For the second, observe that the rational function 
$$
f(x,y) := \frac{y}{x^3-1} \in \cO_C(D)
$$
 and use the Riemann-Roch theorem to conclude that $\{1,f\}$ is a basis for $H^0(\cO_C(D))$.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
With $C$ as in Exercise~\ref{hyperelliptic curve 1}:
Let $D$ be the divisor $D = p + q + r_0 + r_3$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the vector space $H^0(\cO_C(D))$.
\item Describe the map $\phi_{|D|} : C \to \PP^2$.
\item Find the equation of the image curve $\phi_{|D|}(C) \subset \PP^2$, and describe its singularities.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

The following exercises deal with the  
 smooth projective curve $C$ associated to the affine curve $y^3 = x^5 -1$. Note that the map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$ given by the function $x$ expresses $C$ as a cyclic, 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$, branched over the 5th roots of unity and the point at $\infty$. By way of notation, if we take $\eta = e^{2\pi i/5}$ a primitive 5th root of unity, we'll denote by $r_\alpha$ the point $(\eta^\alpha, 0) \in C$ lying over $\eta^\alpha$, and by $p$ the point lying over $\infty \in \PP^1$.


\begin{exercise}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that there is indeed a unique point $p \in C$ lying over $\infty \in \PP^1$, and the map has ramification index 2 at $p$. 
\item Show that the genus of $C$ is 4.
\item Establish the linear equivalences
$$
3p \sim 3r_\alpha \quad \text{and} \quad r_1+ \dots + r_5 \sim 5p.
$$
\item Find a basis for the space $H^0(K_C)$ of regular differentials on $C$.
\item Show that $C$ is not hyperelliptic.
\item Describe the canonical map $\phi_K : C \to \PP^3$ and find the equations of the image.
\item Let $D$ be the divisor $D = r_1+\dots+r_5$. Show that $h^0(K_C(-D)) = 1$; deduce that $r(D) = 2$, and find a basis for $H^0(\cO_C(D))$.
\item If $E = 3p$, show that $r(E) = 1$; that $|E|$ is the unique $g^1_3$ on $C$ and that $2E \sim K$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

Hint(s): For the first part, the easiest way is to describe the monodromy of the cover $C \to \PP^1$ around the point at $\infty$; given the first part, the second follows from Riemann-Hurwitz. For the third, consider the rational functions on $C$ given by $x - \eta^\alpha$ and $y$. For the fourth part, start with the rational differential $\omega = \pi^*dx$ and find rational functions $f$ on $C$ so that $f\omega$ is regular.

For the fifth part, you can use your basis for $H^0(K_C)$ to show that the canonical map is one-to-one; or you can use Exercise~\ref{gonality exclusion} to observe that a curve of genus 4 cannot be simultaneously hyperelliptic and a three-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$. For the sixth, the ideal of the canonical curve is generated by a quadric and a cubic.

\begin{exercise}\label{pa example}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Show that the arithmetic genus of the disjoint union of two lines is $-1$.
\item Let $L\subset Q\subset \PP^3$ be a line on a smooth quadric surface in $\PP^3$. Show that the 
divisor $3L$, regarded as a 1-dimensional scheme, has $p_a(3L) = -2$.
\item Compare these results with the result of simply applying the adjunction formula.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{gonality exclusion}
Show that a curve of genus $g \geq 3$ cannot be simultaneously hyperelliptic and a three-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$.

Hint: If $\mu : C \to \PP^1$ and $\nu : C \to \PP^1$ have degrees 2 and 3, the product map $\mu \times \nu : C \to \PP^1 \times \PP^1$ is a birational embedding; now use the genus formula for curves on $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{planar triple pt}
Show that normalization of the affine planar triple point $xy(x-y) = 0$ in $\AA^2$ is the disjoint union of three
affine lines, $\Spec(\CC[x] \times \CC[y]\times \CC[z])$. Compute the linear conditions on the values and derivatives of three polynomial functions $f,g,h$ defined on
these three lines that they ``descend'' to give a well-defined function on the planar triple point.

Hint: Show first that $\CC[x] \times \CC[y]\times \CC[z]$ is integrally closed, and then that it is a finitely generated module over $\CC[x,y,z]/(xy(x-y))$.
Express a general element of $\CC[x,y,z]/(xy(x-y))$ as a triple of (finite) power series.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} Generalize the results of Exercise~\ref{planar triple pt} to the case of a plane curve with $n$ pairwise
transverse branches, called an \emph{ordinary $n$-fold point}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{delta=1 characterization}
Let $p \in C$ be a singular point of a reduced curve $C$. Show that if $\delta_p = 1$, then $p$ must be either a node or a cusp.

Hint: The statement $\delta_p = 1$ means that there is an exact sequence
$$
0 \to \cO_{C,p} \to\cO_{\tilde C,p} \to \kappa(p) \to 0
$$
where $\kappa(p)$ is the 1-dimensional skyscraper sheaf supported at $p$ and $\cO_{\tilde C,p}$ is
the normalization of $\cO_{C,p}$. Completing this sequence with respect to the maximal ideal
of $\cO_{C,p}$ we get a sequence of the form
$$
0 \to \CC[[x_1,\dots,x_n]] \to \prod_{i=1}^b \CC[[z_i]] \to \kappa(p) \to 0
$$
Reducing modulo $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ we get a right exact sequence
$$
\CC \to \prod_{i=1}^b \CC[[z_i]]/(z_i^{\ell_i}) \to \CC
$$
where $\sum_i (z_i^{\ell_i})$ is the image of $(x_1,\dots x_n)$.
Since $1\mapsto (1,...1)$ under the original left-hand map, the sequence is 
left exact as well. Thus
$\dim_\CC \prod_{i=1}^b \CC[[z_i]]/(z_i^{\ell_i})=2$
from which we see that $b=1, \ell_1 = 2$ or $b = 2, \ell_1=\ell_2 = 1$.

In the former case, the maximal ideal of $\widehat{\sO_{C,p}}$ must have codimension
2 as a vector subspace of $\CC[[z_1]]$. Since $p$ is a singular point, it must be contained in
$(z_1^2)\CC[[z_1]]$, and thus must contain both $z_1^2$ and $z_1^3$. Thus the
ring of the cusp, 
$$
\CC[[x_1,x_2]]/(x_1^3-x_2^2) \cong \CC[[z_1^2, z_1^3]]\subset \widehat{\sO_{C,p}}
$$ 
Since these
both have codimension 1 in $\CC[[z_1]]$, they must be equal.

In the case  $b = 2, \ell_1=\ell_2 = 1$, the maximal ideal $\gm := (x_1,\dots)$ of $\widehat{\sO_{C,p}}$ must have codimension
2 as a vector subspace of $\CC[[z_1]]\times \CC[[z_2]] $, and cannot contain a unit in either factor,
since both closed points of the resolutions map to  $p$. Thus $\gm\subset (z_1)\cup (z_2)$. Again
both these vector spaces have codimension 2 in $\CC[[z_1]]\times \CC[[z_2]] $, so they are
equal, and $\widehat{\sO_{C,p}}$ contains both $z_1$ and $z_2$. Thus
$$
\CC[[z_1,z_2]]/(z_1z_2) \subset \widehat{\sO_{C,p}}
$$ 
and since they both have codimension 1 in $\CC[[z_1]]\times \CC[[z_2]] $ they are equal.
\end{exercise}
