\begin{exercise}\label{here there be basepoints}
 Show that there is no non-constant morphism $\PP^r\to \PP^s$ when $s<r$ by showing that any nontrivial linear
 series of dimension $<r$ on $\PP^r$ has a non-empty base locus.
 
 Hint: Use the principal ideal theorem.
\end{exercise}
 
\begin{exercise}
Extend the statement of Proposition~\ref{very ample} to incomplete linear series; that is, prove that the morphism associated to a linear series $(\cL, V)$ is an embedding iff
$$
\dim\big( V \cap H^0(\cL(-p-q))\big) = \dim V - 2 \quad \forall p, q \in C.
$$
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}\label{normality of RNC}
 Show that $\CC[s^d,s^{d-1}t,\dots, t^d]$ is normal (i.e., integrally closed).
 
 Hint: Its integral closure must be
 contained in $\CC[s,t]$ and if $f$ is any polynomial
 in the integral closure then the homogeneous components of $f$ are also in the integral closure.
\end{exercise}
