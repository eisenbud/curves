10-monodromy.tex: This statement seems even more obvious than Lemma~\ref{finite inflections} above, but---like that lemma---is false in characteristic $p$! \fix{put an example in the exercises?}
10-monodromy.tex:We do not know whether  a general tangent line to a smooth curve $C$ can intersect $C$ in a point other than $p$, except of course in case $r=2$. \fix{Joe will write to Noam to ask for a reference.}

11-BrillNoether.tex:\item Part~\ref{Petri} and Part~\ref{GH} imply Part~\ref{sing wrd}. In fact, a fairly elementary argument \fix{give it?} shows that at a point $\sL  \in W^r_d(C) \setminus W^{r+1}_d(C)$, the tangent space to $W^r_d$ at the point $\sL $ is the annihilator
