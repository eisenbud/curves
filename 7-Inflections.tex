\chapter{Inflection points and the Brill Noether Theorem}
\label{InflectionsChapter}


In this chapter, we will introduce one more aspect of the geometry of linear series on curves, the \emph{inflection points} of a linear system, and use it to give a proof of one implication in the statement of the Brill-Noether theorem.\fix{I changed from "classical B-N" -- ok?}

Inflection points are a generalization to curves in higher-dimensional spaces of the notion of flex points of a smooth plane curve. Just as a point $p \in C$ on a smooth plane curve $C \subset \PP^2$ is called a \emph{flex point} if there is a line $L \subset \PP^2$ having contact of order 3 or more with $C$ at $p$, a point on a smooth, nondegenerate curve $C \subset \PP^r$ will be called an \emph{inflection point} if there is a hyperplane $H \subset \PP^r$ having contact of order $r+1$ or more with $C$ at $p$. This notion can be extended to arbitrary linear series on smooth curves (as opposed to very ample ones); we'll see below that (in characteristic 0) every linear series has finitely many inflection points, and how to count them.


\section{Inflection points,  Pl\"ucker formulas and Weierstrass points}

\subsection{Definitions}

Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, and $\cD = (\cL,V)$ a $g^r_d$ on $C$; that is, $\cL \in \Pic^d(C)$ is a line bundle of degree $d$ on $C$ and $V \subset H^0(\cL)$ is an $(r+1)$-dimensional vector space of sections. \fix{maybe not repeat this here?} \fix{should we stick with "invertible sheaf", as we agreed?} 

To define the inflection points of $\cD$ we introduce a basic

\begin{proposition} For any point $p \in C$, we can find a basis $\sigma_0, \dots, \sigma_r$ of $V$ consisting of sections vanishing to different orders at $p$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} Start with any basis $\tau_0, \dots, \tau_r$. If any two of our basis elements  $\tau_i$ and $\tau_j$ vanish to the same order, then some nonzero linear combination $\tau_i' := a\tau_i+b\tau_j$ must vanish to strictly higher order; since the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are necessarily nonzero we may replace $\tau_i$ with $\tau_i'$. As long as our basis contains elements vanishing to the same order we can repeat this process; since the order $\ord_p(\sigma)$ of any section at $p$ is bounded above by $d$, this process must terminate.
\end{proof}

The set
$$
\{ \ord_p(\sigma) \mid \sigma \neq 0 \in V \}
$$
thus has cardinality $r+1$, and we can write it as
$$
\{ \ord_p(\sigma) \mid \sigma \neq 0 \in V \} = \{a_0,\dots,a_r\} \; \text{ with } \; a_0 < a_1 < \dots < a_r;
$$
the sequence $a_i = a_i(\cD,p)$ is called the \emph{vanishing sequence} of $\cD$ at $p$.  Finally, since $a_i \geq i$, we can set $\alpha_i = \alpha_i(\cD,p) = a_i - i$; the sequence $0 \leq \alpha_0 \leq \alpha_1 \leq \dots \leq \alpha_r$ is called the \emph{ramification sequence} of $\cD$ at $p$, and we say that $p$ is an \emph{inflection point} of the linear series $\cD$ if $(\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_r) \neq (0,\dots,0)$. 

Finally, we define the \emph{weight} of an inflection point to be the sum
$$
w(\cD, p) = \sum_{i=0}^r \alpha_i(\cD, p).
$$

If $\cD$ is very ample, so that it may be viewed at the linear series cut on $C$ by hyperplanes for some embedding $C \subset \PP^r$, then this coincides with the notion above: $p$ is an inflection point if $a_r > r$; that is, if there is a hyperplane $H \subset \PP^r$ having contact of order $r+1$ or more with $C$ at $p$.

Note that the first two terms in the ramification sequence have clear significance: the first, $\alpha_0(\cD, p)$, is nonzero if and only if $p$ is a base point of $\cD$; and $\alpha_0(\cD, p) = 0$ if and only if the map $\phi_\cD$ is an immersion at $p$.


\subsection{The Pl\"ucker formula}

It is a fundamental fact that, in characteristic 0, \emph{a linear series on a smooth projective curve has only finitely many inflection points}. This may seem obvious---try to imagine a plane curve in which every point is a flex!---but it would be false in characteristic $p$: in positive characteristic there exist smooth curves in $\PP^r$ such that every point is an inflection. These are sometimes called ``strange curves'' (see \cite[]{Hartshorne} for an example). 

Given that not every point of $C$ is an inflection point, it is not completely surprising that
the total number of inflection points, properly counted, is determined by $d, g$ and $r$. This is the content of the classical \emph{Pl\"ucker formula}

\begin{theorem}
 \begin{equation}\label{Plucker formula}
\sum_{p \in C} w(\cD, p) \; = \; (r+1)d + r(r+1)(g-1).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
A proof of this statement can be found, for example, in~\cite{} (3264?). Note that this holds in positive characteristic under the hypothesis that the number of inflection points is finite.

The Pl\"ucker formula, while extremely useful (as we'll see in the remainder of this chapter), leaves many questions unanswered: we don't know, for example, what combinations of inflection points are possible. One thing we do know is the behavior of the inflection points for a general linear series; we'll state this here and prove it as a corollary to the proof of the Brill-Noether theorem later in this chapter.

\begin{theorem}
If $C$ is a general curve of genus $g$, $L \in \pic^d(C)$ a general line bundle of degree $d$ with $h^0(L) = r+1$ and $V = H^0(L)$, then every inflection point of the linear series $\cD = (L, V)$ has weight 1 and hence ramification sequence $(0, \dots, 0, 1)$.
\end{theorem}

As a sample application of the Pl\"ucker formula, we can give a simple proof of Proposition~\ref{rnc unique uninflected}, which says that the rational normal curve is the only curve with no inflection points. 

\begin{proof}
Suppose $C \subset \PP^r$ is a curve of degree $d$ and genus $g$; if $C$ has no inflection points, by Pl\"ucker we must have
$$
(r+1)d + r(r+1)(g-1) = 0.
$$
This immediately implies that $g=0$, so that we must have $(r+1)(d-r) = 0$ and hence $d=r$; thus $C$ is a rational normal curve.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Weierstrass points}

As with any extrinsic invariant of a curve in projective space, we can derive an intrinsic invariant of an abstract curve by applying the notion of inflection point to the canonical linear series. 

We define a \emph{Weierstrass point} of a curve $C$ to be an inflection point of the canonical linear series $|K_C|$. This amounts to saying a point $p$ is a Weierstrass point if there exists a  differential form on $C$ vanishing to order $g$ or more at $p$; by the Riemann-Roch theorem, this is tantamount to the condition that $h^0(\cO_C(gp)) \geq 2$, or in other words to saying that there exists a rational function on $C$, regular away from $p$ and having a pole of order $g$ or less at $p$.

We can similarly characterize all the inflection indices of the canonical series at a point. We see from Riemann-Roch that for any $k \geq 0$, there exists a rational function on $C$, regular on $C \setminus \{p\}$ and having a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$---that is,
$$
h^0(\cO_C(kp)) > h^0(\cO_C((k-1)p))\text{---}
$$
if and only if 
$$
h^0(K_C(-kp)) = h^0(K_C((-k+1)p)); 
$$
that is, if and only if there does \emph{not} exist a regular differential on $C$ with a zero of order exactly $k-1$ at $p$. To give the classical terminology, we see from the above that there will exist exactly $g$ values of $k$ such that there does \emph{not} exist a rational function on $C$ with a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$; these are called the \emph{gap values} of the point $p \in C$, and by the above they comprise exactly the vanishing sequence of the canonical series $|K_C|$ at $p$, shifted by 1. Moreover, it is clear that the complement in $\NN$ of the gap values---that is, the set of $k$ such that there \emph{does} exist a rational function on $C$ with a pole of order exactly $k$ at $p$, regular on $C \setminus \{p\}$---forms a semigroup, called the \emph{Weierstrass semigroup} of $p \in C$. Finally, the \emph{weight} $w_p$ of a Weierstrass point $p \in C$  is defined to be the weight $w(|K_C|,p)$ of $p$ as an inflection point of the canonical series.

From the general theory of ramification above, we see that a general point $p$ on any curve $C$ has gap sequence $(1,2,\dots,g)$, and correspondingly the semigroup $W_p = (0, g+1, g+2, \dots)$. A Weierstrass point is called \emph{normal} if it has weight 1; this is tantamount to saying that the gap sequence is $(1,2,\dots,g-1,g+1)$, or that the semigroup is $(0, g, g+2, g+3, \dots)$. (The full Brill-Noether theorem tells us that a general curve $C$ has only normal Weierstrass points; this will be a consequence of Theorem~\ref{BN with inflection and dimension} below.) Finally, the Pl\"ucker formula tells us  the total weight of the Weierstrass points on a given curve $C$: plugging in, we have
$$
\sum_{p \in C} w(|K_C|, p) \; = \; g(2g-2) + (g-1)g(g-1) \; =\;  g^3-g.
$$ 
and hence

\begin{theorem}\label{plucker formula}
The sum of the weights of the Weierstrass points on a curve $C$ of genus $g$ is
$$
\sum_{p \in C} w_p = g^3-g.
$$
\end{theorem}

There is still much we don't know about Weierstrass points in general. Most notably, we don't know what semigroups of finite index in $\NN$ occur as Weierstrass semigroups; an example of Buchweitz shows that not all semigroups occur, but there are also positive results, such as the statement ([EH]) that every semigroup of weight $w \leq g/2$ occurs, and its refinement and strengthening by Pflueger (\cite{**}).

\section{Finiteness of the automorphism group}

As an application of just a rudimentary knowledge of Weierstrass points, we will deduce a fundamental fact: that the automorphism group of a curve of genus $g\geq 2$ is finite. The idea behind the argument is simple: because the Weierstrass points of a curve $C$ are intrinsically defined, \emph{any automorphism of $C$ must carry Weierstrass points to Weierstrass points}. Since there are only finitely many Weierstrass points, then, it will suffice to show that the subgroup of $Aut(C)$ of automorphisms of $C$ that fix all the Weierstrass points individually is finite. In fact, the following two lemmas establish a strong version of this:

\begin{lemma}
Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and $f: C \to C$ an automorphism of $C$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $f$ has $2g+3$ or more distinct fixed points, then $f$ is the identity; and
\item If $f$ has $2g+2$ distinct fixed points, then either $f$ is the identity or $C$ is hyperelliptic and $f$ is the hyperelliptic involution.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
There are two possible arguments here, one invoking the classical topology and applying the Lefschetz fixed point formula and the other more algebro-geometric.

For the first, we recall the definition of the \emph{Lefschetz number} of a map $f : M \to M$ of a compact oriented real $n$-manifold $M$. This is the alternating sum of the traces of the action of $f$ on $H^i(X,\CC)$:
$$
L(f) := \sum_{i=0}^n {\rm Trace}\left(f^* : H^i(X,\CC) \to H^i(X,\CC)\right).
$$
The Lefschetz fixed point formula then says that if $f$ has isolated fixed points, the number of those points, properly counted, is equal to $L(f)$.

In the situation of a smooth projective curve over $\CC$, any automorphism other than the identity has isolated fixed points, and since the map is orientation-preserving \fix{somewhere we need to talk about the classical topology, and  orientation in particular} each fixed point contributes positively to the total; thus the number of distinct fixed points is at most $L(f)$.

Now suppose $f: C \to C$ is any automorphism. Of necessity, $f$ acts as the identity on $H^0(C, \CC)$ and $H^2(C, \CC)$, so if we want to bound $L(f)$ we just have to say something about the action of $f$ on $H^1(C,\CC)$. To do this, note that \fix{note that the reader might not know about the Hodge decomposition!} the action of $f$ on $H^1(C,\CC)$ respects the \emph{Hodge decomposition}
$$
H^1(C,\CC)  = H^0(K_C) \oplus H^1(\cO_C).
$$  
Moreover, the action of $f$ on $H^0(K_C)$ preserves the definite Hermitian inner product
$$
H(\eta, \phi) = \int_C \eta \wedge \overline \phi,
$$
and it follows that \emph{the eigenvalues of the action of $f$ on $H^0(K_C)$ are all complex numbers of absolute value 1}, and likewise for the action on $H^1(\cO_C)$. The absolute value of the trace of $f^*: H^1(C,\CC) \to H^1(C,\CC)$ is thus at most 2g, and hence
$$
L(f) \leq 2 + 2g,
$$
proving the stated inequality in general.

Finally, if we have equality then $f$ must act as $-1$ on $H^1(C,\CC)$, and it follows (again from Lefschetz) that $f^2$ is the identity; applying Riemann-Hurwitz to the map from $C$ to the quotient $B = C/\langle f \rangle$ we may deduce that $B = \PP^1$, so $C$ is hyperelliptic and $f$ the hyperelliptic involution.
\end{proof}

An alternative, more algebraic argument for the lemma may be given using the intersection pairing on the surface $S = C \times C$ and applying the index theorem for surfaces. To carry this out, let $\Delta$ and $\Gamma \subset S$ be the diagonal and the graph of $f$ respectively, and let $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2 \subset S$ be fibers of the two projection maps; let $\delta, \gamma, \varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2 \in N(S)$ be the classes of these curves in the Neron-Severi group of $S$. We are trying to estimate the intersection number $b = \delta \cdot \gamma$. \fix{this argument needs more explanation too.}

We know all the other pairwise intersection number of these classes: the ones involving $\varphi_1$ or $\varphi_2$ are obvious; we have
$$
\delta^2 = 2 - 2g
$$
and since the automorphism $id_C \times f : C\times C \to C \times C$ carries $\Delta$ to $\Gamma$, we see that $\gamma^2 = 2-2g$ as well.

We can now apply the index theorem for surfaces to deduce our inequality. To keep things relatively simple, let's introduce two new classes: set
$$
\delta' = \delta - \varphi_1 - \varphi_2 \quad \text{and} \quad \gamma' = \gamma - \varphi_1 - \varphi_2,
$$
so that $\delta'$ and $\gamma'$ are orthogonal to the class $\varphi_1 + \varphi_2$. Since $\varphi_1 + \varphi_2$ has positive self-intersection, the index theorem tells us that the intersection pairing must be negative definite on the span $\langle \delta',\gamma' \rangle \subset N(S)$. In particular, the determinant of the intersection matrix
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
& $\delta'$ &  $\gamma'$  \\
\hline
$\delta'$ & $-2g$ & $b-2$ \\
\hline
$\gamma'$ & $b-2$ & $-2g$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
(where again $b = \gamma \cdot \delta$) must be nonnegative, from which our inequality follows.

Having established an upper bound on the number of fixed points an automorphism $f$ of $C$ (other than the identity) may have, it remains to find a lower bound on the number of distinct Weierstrass points; this is the content of the next lemma.


\begin{lemma}
If $C$ is a smooth projective curve of genus $g \geq 2$, then $C$ has at least $2g+2$ distinct Weierstrass points; and if it has exactly $2g+2$ Weierstrass points it is hyperelliptic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $p \in C$ be any point, and $w_1=w_1(p),\dots,w_g = w_g(p)$ the ramification sequence of the canonical series $|K_C|$ at $p$. By definition, 
$$
h^0(K_C(-(w_i+i)p)) = g - i.
$$
Applying Clifford's theorem we have
$$
g-i \leq \frac{2g - 2 - w_i - i}{2} + 1;
$$
solving, we see that
$$
w_i \leq i
$$
and hence
$$
w_p \leq \binom{g}{2}
$$
where $w_p$ is the total weight of $p$ as a Weierstrass point. Since the total weight of the Weierstrass points on $C$ is $g^3-g$ by the Pl\"ucker formula~\ref{***}, we see that the number of distinct Weierstrass points must be at least
$$
\frac{g^3-g}{\binom{g}{2}} = 2g+2.
$$
Finally, by the strong form of Clifford's Theorem \ref{***}, equality here implies that the curve is hyperelliptic.
\end{proof}




\section{Proof of (half of) the Brill-Noether theorem}

In its most basic form, the Brill-Noether theorem asserts for any $d, g$ and $r$ that
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $\rho(g,r,d) := g - (r+1)(g-d+r) \geq 0$, then every curve $C$ of genus $g$ possesses a $g^r_d$; and
\item if $\rho < 0$ then a general curve of genus $g$ does not possess a $g^r_d$.
\end{enumerate}

The first part, often called the ``existence half" of Brill-Noether, was originally proved by Kempf (\cite{}) and Kleiman-Laksov (\cite{}); both proofs relied on an application of the Thom-Porteous formula to a particular map of vector bundles on the Jacobian of $C$. An account of this argument may  be found in Appendix A of \cite{}. 

We will now apply the notion of inflection points, and the Pl\"ucker formula in particular, to deduce the second half of the statement above---the ``nonexistence half." We will then go back and deduce some of the other parts of the  full Brill-Noether statement from the same set-up.\fix{full B-N is your language; I don't think it's standard. I guess it will have been stated by now? so there should be a backward ref.}

Our proof will follow a suggestion of Castelnuovo, by specializing a smooth curve of genus $g$ to a general rational curve with $g$ nodes, and our first task is to say what we mean by this.

\subsubsection{Constructing nodal curves}

Let $C$ be a smooth curve, and $p, q \in C$ two distinct smooth points of $C$. We would like to identify the two points $p$ and $q$ to form a nodal curve $C'$. To start, as a topological space, $C'$ will be simply the quotient of $C$ by the equivalence relation $p \sim q$; we'll denote by $r \in C'$ the point corresponding to the equivalence class $\{p, q\}$. Next, we have to specify the structure sheaf of $C'$, which is likewise straightforward: away from the point $r$, $C'$ will be isomorphic to $C \setminus \{p,q\}$; in other words, for a point $s \neq r \in C'$, we take the local ring $\cO_{s, C'} = \cO_{s,C}$. As for the local ring $\cO_{r, C'}$, we set
$$
\cO_{r, C'} := \left\{ (f,g) \in \cO_{p,C} \oplus \cO_{q,C} \mid f(p) = g(q) \right\}.
$$

To see that this is indeed a scheme, we can make a construction. First, embed $C$ in a high-dimensional projective space $\PP^n$ by a linear series of degree $d > 2g+2$, and then project from a general point on the secant line $\overline{p,q}$. We claim that the image of the projection map is the curve described above; we leave the verification as the following exercise.

\begin{exercise}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using the fact that $d > 2g+2$, show that no two secant or tangent lines to $C \subset \PP^n$ meet; and
\item Deduce from this that the image $C' = \pi(C)$ is the curve constructed above.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

In fact, an extension of this construction may be applied when $C$ is singular, as long as $p$ and $q$ are smooth points of $C$, so that in particular we can identify multiple pairs of smooth point $p_i, q_i \in C$. For example, if $p_1,\dots,p_g, q_1,\dots, q_g \in \PP^1$ are general points, we can form a curve $C'$ of arithmetic genus $g$ by identifying each pair $p_i, q_i$ in this way; we may call the resulting curve the \emph{general $g$-nodal rational curve}.

\subsubsection{Castelnuovo's proposal}

Consider a family of curves $\pi : \cC \to B$, where
\begin{enumerate}
\item $B$ is a smooth curve, with distinguished point $0 \in B$;
\item for all $b \neq 0 \in B$, the fiber $C_b = \pi^{-1}(b)$ is a smooth, projective curve of genus $g$;  and
\item the fiber $C_0$ over $0$ is a rational curve with $g$ ordinary cusps.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}\label{BN in family}
If $\cC \to B$ is a family of curves as above, then for general $b \in B$ the fiber $C_b$ does not possess a $g^r_d$ with $\rho < 0$.
\end{lemma}

Once we establish the existence of such a family, we deduce the basic

\begin{theorem}\label{bare-bones BN}
A general curve $C$ of genus $g$ does not possess a $g^r_d$ with $\rho(g,r,d) < 0$.
\end{theorem}


The basic outline of the argument is by contradiction, but straightforward: we assume that the general curve $C_b$ in the family does have a $g^r_d$, consider what the limit of those $g^r_d$s might look like and, using our knowledge of the relatively simple curve $C_0$, arrive at a contradiction. By way of notation, let $B^\circ = B \setminus \{0\}$ and let $\cC^\circ = \pi^{-1}(B^\circ)$ be the complement in $\cC$ of the special fiber. The proof proceeds essentially in four/five steps.

\

\noindent {\bf Step 0: Existence of such a family}

\begin{lemma}\label{cusp smoothing lemma}
For each $g$, there exists a family $\cC \to B$ of curves with $B$ smooth and one-dimensional; $C_b$ a smooth curve of genus $g$ for $b \neq 0 \in B$ and $C_0$ a rational curve with $g$ cusps.
\end{lemma}

\

\noindent {\bf Step 1: Finding a family of $g^r_d$s over $B^\circ$}

Suppose now that the general curve $C_b$ in the family does have a line bundle  of degree $d$ with $r+1$ sections. The first thing to observe is that, possibly after a base change, we can pick out one such line bundle $\cL_b$ for each $b \neq 0$, varying regularly with $b$; or, in other words \emph{there exists a  line bundle $\cL^\circ$ on the complement $\cC^\circ$ of the special fiber such that}
$$
\deg(\cL^\circ|_{C_b}) = d \quad \text{and} \quad h^0(\cL^\circ|_{C_b}) \geq r+1
$$
for all $b \neq 0 \in B$. \fix{need to give argument for this assertion}

\

\noindent {\bf Step 2: Extending the line bundle $\cL^\circ$ to a sheaf on all of $\cC$}

Next, we want to extend $\cL^\circ$ to a sheaf on all of $\cC$. We claim that \emph{there exists a torsion-free sheaf $\cL$ on all of $\cC$ such that $\cL|_{\cC^\circ} \cong \cL^\circ$}.

To see this, we choose an auxiliary line bundle $\cM$ on $\cC$ with relative degree $e > d + 2g$ (for example, embed $\cC$ is projective space and take $\cM = \cO_{\cC}(m)$ for large $m$); in keeping with our notational conventions, let $\cM^\circ$ be the restriction of $\cM$ to $\cL^\circ$. Consider the line bundle 
$$
\cN^\circ = (\cL^\circ)^* \otimes \cM^\circ.
$$
The bundle $\cN^\circ$ has lots of sections: the direct image is locally free of rank $e-g+1 > 0$, and after restricting to an open neighborhood of $0 \in B$ we can assume it's generated by them. Choose a section $\sigma$ of $\cN^\circ$; let $D^\circ \subset \cC^\circ$ be its zero divisor, and let $D \subset \cC$ be the closure of $D^\circ$ in $\cC$. Now, away from $C_0$ we can write
$$
\cL^\circ = (\cN^\circ)^* \otimes \cM^\circ = \cI_{D^\circ/\cC^\circ} \otimes \cM^\circ
$$
and accordingly the sheaf
$$
\cL := \cI_{D/\cC} \otimes \cM
$$
is the desired sheaf. Note that this need not be locally free: the total space $\cC$ of our family may not be smooth at the cusps of the special fiber $C_0$ (even if the family we originally started with had smooth total space, the base change called for in Step 1 would yield a family with  total space singular at the cusps of $C_0$), and if $D$ passes through any of these points it need not be Cartier.

In sum, if the general fiber $C_b$ of our family has a $g^r_d$, we can conclude that the special fiber $C_0$ has a torsion-free sheaf $\cL_0$ with 
$$
c_1(\cL_0) = d;
$$
and, by upper-semicontinuity of cohomolgy,
$$
h^0(\cL_0) \geq r+1.
$$

\

\noindent {\bf Step 3: Local description of the sheaf $\cL_0$}

The next question is, what does $\cL_0$ look like if it's not locally free? Here we have a basic lemma:

\begin{lemma}\label{torsion free at cusp}
Let $p$ be a  cusp of a curve $C$. If $\cF$ is a torsion-free sheaf on $C$, then in a neighborhood of $p$ in $C$ the sheaf $\cF$ is either locally free or isomorphic to the ideal sheaf $\cI_{p/C}$ of $p$ in $C$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the endomorphism ring of $\cF$, and note that it is commutative and integral over $\cO_{p/C}$; thus it is either 
$\cO_{p/C}$ or it's integral closure $\cO_{p/\tilde C}$. In the latter case it is  free over $\cO_{p/\tilde C}\cong \cI_{p/C}$.
In the former case....\fix{complete the argument}

\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show  that the conclusion of Lemma~\ref{torsion free at cusp} holds in case $p$ is a node of $C$
\item Show by example that the conclusion of Lemma~\ref{torsion free at cusp} is false in case $p$ is either a tacnode or a triple point of $C$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\noindent {\bf Step 4: Applying the Pl\"ucker formula}

Now, back to our family $\pi : \cC \to B$ of curves. We have assumed that for some $d$ and $r$ with $\rho(g,r,d) < 0$ the general curve $C_b$ has a $g^r_d$, and deduced that the special fiber $C_0$ has a rank 1 torsion-free sheaf $\cL_0$ of degree $d$ with at least $r+1$ sections; we now have to derive from this a contradiction.

To see most clearly where this contradiction comes from, let's start with the simplest case: where $\cL_0$ is indeed locally free. In this case, let $\nu :  C^\nu \cong \PP^1 \to C$ be the normalization of $C$ and let $q_1,\dots, q_g \in \PP^1$ be the points lying over the cusps of $C_0$. We have
$$
\nu^*(\cL) \cong \cO_{\PP^1}(d)
$$  
and 
$$
V = \nu^*(H^0(\cL_0)) \subset H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(d))
$$
is an $(r+1)$-dimensional space of sections. (If $H^0(\cL_0) > r+1$, just choose any $(r+1)$-dimensional subspace.) 

Now, given that any section $\sigma \in V \subset H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(d))$ is pulled back from the cuspidal curve $C$, we see that \emph{$\sigma$ cannot vanish to order exactly 1 at the point $q_i \in \PP^1$ lying over any of the cusps of $C_0$}. It follows that for each $i$ the ramification index 
$$
\alpha_1(V,q_i) \geq 1 
$$
and hence in  general $\alpha_1(q_i,V) \geq 1$ for all $i \geq 1$. In particular, the weight of the inflection point $q_i$ for the linear series $V$ satisfies
$$
w(V, q_i) \geq r
$$
and correspondingly
$$
\sum_{i=1}^g w(V, q_i) \geq rg
$$
But the Pl\"ucker formula~\ref{} tells us that the total weight of all inflection points for the series $V$ is
$$
\sum_{p \in \PP^1} w(V,p) = (r+1)(d-r)
$$
and there's our contradiction: by the hypothesis that 
$$
\rho(g,r,d) := g - (r+1)(g-d+r) < 0
$$
we have $rg > (r+1)(d-r)$.

Finally, the case where $\cL_0$ is not locally free is if anything even easier. Suppose now that the sheaf $\cL$ fails to be locally free at $l$ of the cusps of $C_0$, say $\nu(p_1),\dots,\nu(p_l)$. Again, we can pull $\cL$ back to $\PP^1$; again we have
$$
\nu^*(\cL_0) \cong \cO_{\PP^1}(d);
$$  
and again we pull back section of $\cL$ to arrive at a linear system
$$
V = \nu^*(H^0(\cL_0)) \subset H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(d))
$$
of degree $d$ and genus $g$ on $\PP^1$. The only difference here is that sections of $V$ all vanish at $p_1,\dots,p_l$, so that we have
$$
w(V,p_k) \geq 
\begin{cases}
r+1 &\text{ if } k \leq l; \text{ and} \\
r  &\text{ if } k > l.
\end{cases}
$$
so that
$$
\sum_{k=1}^g w(V, p_k) \geq rg + l
$$
and our contradiction is even more of a contradiction!

\section{Corollaries and extensions of our proof}

We have proved a bare-bones version of the nonexistence half of Brill-Noether; in particular, the argument does not a priori tell us anything about the geometry of $W^r_d(C)$ for a general curve $C$, or the geometry of $C$ as embedded by a general linear system. In the final section of this chapter, we'll see how we can deduce stronger forms of Brill-Noether from the basic set-up above.

\subsection{Brill-Noether with inflection}

Let's start with the low-hanging fruit. Since the basic ingredient of the proof of Theorem~\ref{bare-bones BN} is the Pl\"ucker formula, the argument tells us something about the inflection points of linear series on a general curve $C$ as well.

We start with a definition.

\begin{definition}
Let $C$ be a smooth curve of genus $g$ and $p_1,\dots,p_n \in C$ distinct points of $C$. If $\cD = (L,V)$ is a linear system on $C$ of degree $d$ and dimension $r$, we define the \emph{adjusted Brill-Noether number} of $\cD$ relative to the points $p_k$ to be
$$
\rho(\cD; p_1,\dots,p_k) := g - (r+1)(g-d+r) - \sum_{k=1}^n w(\cD,p_k).
$$
\end{definition}

In these terms, we have the basic (but powerful) extension of the Brill-Noether theorem proved above:

\begin{theorem}\label{Brill-Noether with inflection}
Let $(C;p_1,\dots,p_n)$ be a general $n$-pointed curve of genus $g$ (that is, let $C$ be a general curve and $p_1,\dots,p_n \in C$ general points; equivalently, let $(C;p_1,\dots,p_n)$ correspond to a general point of $M_{g,n}$). If $\cD$ is any linear system on $C$, then
$$
\rho(\cD; p_1,\dots,p_k) \geq 0.
$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof is just an extension of the argument for Lemma~\ref{BN in family}. To start, let $\cC \to B$ be a family of curves as in the proof of Lemma~\ref{cusp smoothing lemma}. Let $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n : B \to \cC$ be sections of $\cC \to B$ with $\sigma_k(0)$ a smooth point of $C_0$ for all $k$ (such sections can always be found after passing to an \'etale open neighborhood of $0 \in B$). Exactly as in the proof of Lemma~\ref{BN in family}, if the general curve $C_b$ in our family admits a $g^r_d$ $\cD$ with
$$
\rho(\cD;\sigma_1(b),\dots,\sigma_n(b)) < 0
$$
we can choose a family $\{\cD_b\}$ of such linear series on the fibers $C_b$ for $b \neq 0$ and, taking limits, we arrive at a $g^r_d$ $\cD_0$ on $\PP^1$ with
$$
w(\cD_0, q_i) \geq r
$$
for each of the $g$ points $q_i \in \PP^1$ lying over the cusps of $C_0$, and in addition
$$
w(\cD_0, r_k) \geq w(\cD_b,\sigma_k(b))
$$
where $r_k \in \PP^1$ is the point in $\PP^1$ lying over $\sigma_k(0) \in C_0$. Adding up, we have
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^g w(\cD_0, q_i) + \sum_{k=1}^n w(\cD_0, r_i) &\geq rg + \sum_{k=1}^n w(\cD_b,\sigma_k(b)) \\
&> rg + g - (r+1)(g-d+r) = (r+1)(d-r)
\end{align*}
since we assumed that 
$$
\rho(\cD_b;\sigma_1(b),\dots,\sigma_n(b)) = g - (r+1)(g-d+r) - \sum_{k=1}^n w(\cD_b,\sigma_k(b)) < 0.
$$
But as before the Pl\"ucker formula for $\PP^1$ tells us that
$$
\sum_{p \in \PP^1} w(\cD_0, p) = (r+1)(d-r),
$$
a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Brill-Noether with dimension}

Theorem~\ref{Brill-Noether with inflection} might at first glance seem relevant only to problems involving inflection, but in fact in can be used to prove results that have nothing to do with inflection points. For example, one consequence is the stronger form of Brill-Noether:

\begin{theorem}\label{BN with dimension}
If $C$ is a general curve of genus $g$, then for any $d$ and $r$ with $\rho(g,r,d) \geq 0$,
$$
\dim W^r_d(C) = \rho(g,r,d).
$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The basic idea of the proof is simple: basically, we argue that if we had a $(\rho+1)$-dimensional family of $g^r_ds$ on $C$, then we could find one with nonzero ramification at $\rho+1$ general points of $C$, violating Theorem~\ref{Brill-Noether with inflection}.

This idea is easier to implement after specializing, so once more we go back to our family $\cC \to B$ of smooth curves specializing to a $g$-cuspidal curve $C_0$, with normalization $\PP^1$. The basic lemma is:

\begin{lemma}\label{forced ramification}
Let $\Sigma$ be a complete curve and let $\{ \cD_\lambda \}_{\lambda \in \Sigma}$ be a (nonconstant) family of $g^r_ds$ on $\PP^1$ parametrized by $\Sigma$. If $p \in \PP^1$ is any fixed point, then for at least one $\lambda \in \Sigma$ we have $w(\cD_\lambda,p)>0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Embed $\PP^1$ in $\PP^d$ as a rational normal curve of degree $d$. Given a $(d-r-1)$-plane $\Lambda \subset \PP^d$, the hyperplanes in $\PP^d$ containing $\Lambda$ cut out a $g^r_d$ $\cD_\Lambda$ on $\PP^1$, and indeed every $g^r_d$ on $\PP^1$ can be described in this way for a unique $\Lambda$. The $g^r_d$s on $\PP^1$ are thus parametrized by the Grassmannian $\GG(d-r-1,d)$, and we can think of $\Sigma$ as a complete curve in $\GG(d-r-1,d)$.

Consider now the hyperplanes $H \subset \PP^d$ such that the divisor $H \cap \PP^1$ has multiplicity $\geq r+1$ at $p$. These correspond to points in a linear space of codimension $r+1$ in $(\PP^d)^*$; in particular, their intersection is an $r$-plane $\Omega \subset \PP^d$, called the \emph{osculating plane} to the rational normal curve at $p$. The condition that a  $g^r_d$ $\cD_\Lambda$ have non-zero ramification at $p$---in other words, that $\cD_\Lambda$ contains a divisor with multiplicity $\geq r+1$ at $p$---is simply that $\Lambda \cap \Omega \neq \emptyset$. But the set of such $\Lambda$ is a hyperplane section of $\GG(d-r-1,d)$ under trhe Pl\"ucker embedding; in particular, any complete curve $\Sigma \subset \GG(d-r-1,d)$ must intersect it.
\end{proof}

Given this lemma, the proof of Theorem~\ref{BN with dimension} proceeds as follows. We know from the basic dimension estimates of Chapter~\ref{} that $\dim W^r_d(C) \geq \rho(g,r,d)$ for any $C$; we have to show that we cannot have $\dim W^r_d(C) > \rho(g,r,d)$ for a general curve $C$. We argue as follows:

First: if it were the case that $\dim W^r_d(C) > \rho(g,r,d)$ for a general curve $C$, we would have, after specializing and pulling back to $\PP^1$, at least a $(\rho + 1)$-dimensional family of $g^r_d$s on $\PP^1$, all of which had ramification weight at least $r$ at the points $q_i$ of $\PP^1$ lying over the cusps of $C_0$. 

Secondly, we pick any $\rho + 1$ points $r_k \in \PP^1$ other than the $q_i$. Applying Lemma~\ref{forced ramification} repeatedly, we find that there is at least a $\rho$-dimensional subfamily of $g^r_d$s having nonzero ramification at $p_1$, a $(\rho - 1)$-dimensional subfamily of $g^r_d$s having nonzero ramification at $p_1$ and $p_2$, and so on; ultimately, we conclude that there is a $g^r_d$ $\cD$ on $\PP^1$ with ramification index at least $r$ at each $q_i$ and nonzero ramification index at each $r_k$. 

Finally, we observe that the linear series $\cD$ has total ramification at least
$$
rg + \rho + 1 = (r+1)(d-r)+1
$$
at the points $q_i$ and $r_k$, once more violating the Pl\"ucker formula.
\end{proof}

We can combine Theorem~\ref{BN with dimension} and Theorem~\ref{Brill-Noether with inflection} into one theorem, more complicated but more inclusive:

\begin{theorem}\label{BN with inflection and dimension}
Let $C$ be a smooth curve of genus $g$ and $p_1,\dots,p_n \in C$ distinct points; for $k = 1,\dots,n$ let $\alpha^k = (\alpha^k_0,\dots\alpha^k_r)$ be a nondecreasing sequence of nonnegative integers, and let
$$
G^r_d(p_1,\dots,p_n; \alpha^1,\dots,\alpha^n) = \{\cD \in G^r_d(D) \mid \alpha_i(\cD, p_k) \geq \alpha^k_i \}.
$$
If $(C, p_1,\dots,p_n)$ is a general $n$-pointed curve, then either $G^r_d(p_1,\dots,p_n; \alpha^1,\dots,\alpha^n)$ is empty or
$$
\dim G^r_d(p_1,\dots,p_n; \alpha^1,\dots,\alpha^n) = \rho(g,r,d) - \sum_{k+1}^n \sum_{i=0}^r \alpha^k_i.
$$
\end{theorem}

Finally, we can combine this last theorem with a little dimension-counting to deduce a simple fact:

\begin{theorem}
If $\cD$ is a general $g^r_d$ on a general curve, then $\cD$ has only simple ramification; that is,
$$
w(\cD, p) \leq 1 \quad \text{for all } p \in C.
$$
\end{theorem}

Note that applying this in case $d=2g-2$ and $r = g-1$, we arrive at the statement made earlier: that a general curve $C$ of genus $g$ has only normal Weierstrass points!
