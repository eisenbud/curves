\label{genus 0 chapter}\label{3a}\label{genus 0 and 1 chapter}

We
begin our project of describing curves in projective space with the
simplest case,
that of
genus 0.
Even here, there are interesting
statements to make about the geometry of their embeddings in $\PP^r` `$,
and there are many open problems.
Though we won't treat such questions, curves of genus $0$ over other fields pose their own interesting problems: the study of such curves
over $\QQ$ was a major part of
Gauss's
work.
\index{Gauss, Leonhard}%
\index{genus 0!curves of}%

Using Theorem~\ref{characterization of P1} and the
Riemann--Roch theorem,
\index{Riemann--Roch theorem}%
we can show that (over an algebraically closed field) $\PP^1$
is the only curve of arithmetic genus 0:

\begin{corollary}
 Every reduced irreducible projective curve $C$ of arithmetic genus~$0$
over an algebraically closed field is isomorphic to $\PP^1` `$.
\unif
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The curve $C$ is smooth since otherwise its normalization would have negative genus.
By the Riemann--Roch theorem, any linear series $\cL$ of degree $d$ on $C$ has $h^0(\cL) \geq d+1$, so we may use Theorem~\ref{characterization of P1}
to conclude that $C\cong\nobreak \PP^1` `$.
\unif
\end{proof}

Even images of genus 0 curves must have genus 0. The following proof works as well if we replace $\CC$ by any algebraically
closed field.

\begin{npt}
\begin{theorem}[\cite{Luroth}]\label{Lueroth}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $C\to D$ is a nonconstant map of reduced, irreducible projective curves, then the geometric genus of $C$ must be at least that of $D$.
\index{L\"uroth!Jacob}%
In particular, if $C$ has geometric genus \0,
then
so does
$D$.
 \item If $K$ is a field with $\CC \subsetneq K \subset \CC(x)$
  then $K = \CC(y)$ for some $y \in \CC(x)$.
\unif
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\end{npt}

\begin{proof}
\noindent (1) Normalizing, we get a map  $ \tilde C \to \tilde D$, and
the first statement follows from
Hurwitz's theorem.
\index{Hurwitz's theorem}%

\smallbreak

\noindent (2) Since $\CC$ is algebraically closed,
$K$ is a
transcendental extension.
\index{transcendental extension}%
\vadjust{\allowbreak}%
Since $\CC(x)$ has
transcendence degree 1, if $z\in K\setminus \CC$
then $x$ is algebraic over $\CC(z)$. Thus $\CC(x)$ is finite over $\CC(z)$, so $K$ is finite over $\CC(z)$
as well. In particular, $K$ is finitely generated over $\CC$. It follows that $K$ is the field of rational functions
on a curve $D$, and the inclusion $K\subset \CC(x)$ corresponds to a finite map $\PP^1\to D$. Applying
part (1),
we see that $D\cong \PP^1$ so $K \cong \CC(y)$ for some $y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}[(rational curves over other fields)]
\emph{L\"uroth's theorem} refers to statement (2) in Theorem \ref{Lueroth}.
\index{L\"uroth's theorem}%
For an elementary proof of it, valid over any
field, see
\cite[Section 8.13]{JacobsonII}.

Over a non-algebraically closed field, a curve $C$ of genus 0 need not have any points, or any invertible sheaves of odd degree. Since the canonical bundle $K_C$ has degree $-2$, there necessarily exist invertible sheaves of every even degree; thus an arbitrary curve of genus 0 is isomorphic to a  plane conic.
\index{plane conic}%

A projective curve of genus 0 over a field $k$ is called a
\,\emph{form}
\index{form of $\PP\sp1$}%
of $\PP^1$ if it becomes isomorphic to $\PP^1$ after extension
of scalars to
the algebraic closure of $k$. The unique example with $k = \RR$ that
is not isomorphic over $\RR$ to $\PP^1$
is the conic with no $\RR$-rational points, $x^2+y^2+z^2 = 0$.
The classification of curves of genus 0 over $\QQ$ is a subject that goes back to Gauss.



Noncommutative algebras enter the subject of forms of $\PP^1$ (and
$\PP^n$ more generally) in a surprising way: The curve $\PP_k^1$
itself may be described as the scheme of
\index{left ideals!scheme of}%
left ideals of $k$-vector-space dimension 2 in the ring of
$2\times 2$ matrices over $k$: such an ideal can be embedded in the
matrix ring as a linear combination of the 2 columns in an appropriate sense.
More generally, any scheme that is a form of $\PP^1$ over $k$
may be described as the scheme of 2-dimensional left ideals in a
4-dimensional central simple ($=$
Azumaya) algebra
\index{Azumaya algebra}%
over $k$. For example, the
conic $x^2+y^2+z^2 = 0$ with no points over $\RR$ is the scheme of
left ideals in the algebra of
quaternions.
\index{quaternions}%
See \cite[Section X.6]{Serre1979}.

 There is an analogue
of the last statement of part (1) of Theorem \ref{Lueroth}
for rational surfaces,
proved
by
\index{Castelnuovo, Guido}%
Castelnuovo: every complex surface admitting a dominant rational
map from $\PP^2$ is rational (see \cite[Corollary V.5]{Beauville}, for
example).
However, the analogue in higher
dimensions
is false; for example, \cite{MR0302652} shows that a smooth cubic threefold $X$ admits a dominant rational map $\PP^3 \to X$ but is not rational.

\end{fact}

\section{Rational normal curves}\label{rational normal curves section}

\subsubsection*{The homogeneous coordinate ring of a rational normal curve}

If $\sV = (V,\sL)$ is a linear series on a scheme $X$, then the inclusion
$V\subset H^0(\sL)$ induces by multiplication a map
$$
\rho_{\sV}: \Sym(V) \to  \bigoplus_{n\in \ZZ} H^0(\sL^n)
$$
from the symmetric algebra of $V$.
\index{Sym@$\Sym(V)$, $\Sym^d(V)$, $\Sym^e(V)$}%
When $\sV$ embeds $X$ in $\PP^r = \PP V` `$, the image $R_{X}$ of this map is called the \emph{homogeneous coordinate ring} of $X$.
\index{homogeneous coordinate ring}%
\index{coordinate ring!homogeneous}%

The
rational normal curve
\index{rational normal curve}%
$C\subset \PP^d$ of degree $d$ is embedded by the complete linear series
$\sV = (\sO_{\PP^1}(d), \CC[s,t]_d)$. Since any form of degree $nd$ in $\CC[s,t]$ is a sum of products of $n$ forms of degree $d$,
the corresponding homogeneous coordinate ring of the rational normal curve is
$$
\CC[s,t]_{(d)} \colonequals \bigoplus_n(\CC[s,t]_{nd}),
$$
and the map $\rho_{\sV}$ is surjective. This is expressed by saying
that $C$ is
\emph{arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay};
\index{ACM}%
\index{arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay}%
more generally, if $C\subset \PP^r$ is
\index{linearly normal}%
\index{quadratically normal}%
\index{normal!linearly / quadratically / $n$-ically}%
a one-dimensional scheme, we say that $C$ is linearly (respectively, quadratically, \dots, $n$-ically) normal
if  the natural maps
$$
\rho_m: H^0(\sO_{\PP^r}(m)) \to H^0(\sO_{C}(m))
$$
are surjective for  $m=1$ (respectively $m=2,\dots, m=n$). We say that $C$ is arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay
(usually abbreviated ACM)
 when $\rho_m$ is surjective for all $m$. We'll discuss the
 significance of this condition in Section~\ref{ACM},
and we will prove that it is equivalent to the condition
that $R_{C}$ is a Cohen--Macaulay ring, justifying
\index{Cohen--Macaulay ring}%
 the name.



\subsubsection*{The equations defining a rational normal curve}

Choosing a basis $s,t$ for the linear forms on $\PP^1` `$, we can
write the $d$-th
\index{Veronese!map}%
Veronese map $\PP^{1}\to \PP^{d}$ as
$$
\phi_d : (s,t) \mapsto (s^d, s^{d-1}t,\dots, t^d)
,
$$
from which we see that the image $C$ of $\phi_d$ lies in the zero locus of the homogeneous quadratic polynomial $x_i x_j - x_{i+1}x_{j-1}$ for every $i,j$. We can realize these quadratic forms as the $2\times 2$ minors of the matrix
$$
M \; = \; \begin{pmatrix}
x_0 & x_1 & \dots & x_{d-1} \\
x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_d
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Note that if we substitute $s^it^{(d-i)}$ for $x_i$ and identify $H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(i))$ with $\CC[s,t]_i$, this becomes the multiplication table
$$
H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(1)) \times H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(d{-}1)) \to H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(d)).
$$


It is easy to see that $C$ is
set-theoretically
\index{set-theoretic equality}%
\index{minors, $2\times 2$}%
defined by the $2\times 2$ minors of $M$: the affine set $s=1$ in $\PP^1$ maps
to the affine set $x_0 = 1$ in $\PP^d` `$, and the affine form of the map is $t \mapsto (t, t^2, \dots, t^d)$. But if $x_1 = t$ then from
the equations $x_0x_i = x_1x_{i-1}$ we see successively that $x_i = t^i$;
that is, the vanishing of the minors of $M$ at a point $p$
implies that $p$ lies on $C$.

A much stronger statement is true:

\begin{proposition}\label{RNC generators} The homogeneous ideal of the
rational normal curve
\index{rational normal curve}%
$$
\PP^1 \rOnto C \subset \PP^d,\quad (s,t) \mapsto (s^d, s^{d-1}t, \dots, t^d),
$$
 is generated by the
 $2\times 2$ minors of $M$.
  \end{proposition}

% By way of notation, we write
% $\CC[s,t]_{(d)}$ for the subring of $\CC[s,t]$ generated by all forms whose degree is a multiple of $d$.
% Since any monomial of degree $nd$ is a product of $n$ monomials of degree $d$, the map
% $$
% \Sym^d H^0(\sO_{\PP^1}(n)) \to H^0(\sO_{\PP^1}(nd)) = \CC[s,t]_{nd}
% $$
% corresponding to $\phi_d$ is surjective, so $\CC[s,t]_{(d)}$ is the homogeneous coordinate ring of $C$,
% and the Proposition amounts to saying that $\CC[x_0,\dots, x_d]/I \cong \CC[s,t]_{(d)}$.
%

\begin{proof}
Let $I\subset \CC[x_0,\dots, x_d]$ be the ideal generated by the $2\times 2$ minors of $M$.
As we have seen, the map
$$
\phi: \CC[x_0, \dots, x_d]/I \rOnto \CC[s,t]_{(d)},\quad x_i\mapsto s^{d-i}t^i,
$$
is surjective, and we must show that this is a monomorphism, or equivalently that the source of $\phi$ in degree $n$ has
(at most) the same dimension $nd+1$ as the target of $\phi$ in degree $nd$.

If $0<i\leq j<d$ then
$$
x_ix_j \equiv x_{i-1}x_{j+1}  \ (\mathrm{ mod}\ I).
$$
Thus every monomial in the $x_i$ of degree $t$ is equivalent, modulo $I$, to a monomial of the form
 $$
 x_0^ax_1^{\epsilon_1}\cdots x_{d-1}^{\epsilon_{d-1}}x_d^b
 $$
 where at most one $\epsilon_i$ is 1, and the rest are 0. There are $n+1$ such elements of degree $n$ with all the $\epsilon_i = 0$
 and $n(d-1)$ elements with one of the $\epsilon_i = 1$. Thus there are $nd+1$ such elements in all, proving that $\phi$ is
 an isomorphism.
  \end{proof}

\begin{fact}\label{Veronese equations fact}
The description of the equations above can be considerably extended;
see Proposition~\ref{some equations}. For example, the equations of the
\index{Veronese!surface}%
Veronese surface, which is the image of $\PP^{2}$
 under the complete linear system of quadrics, is defined by the $2\times 2$ minors of the generic
 symmetric matrix
 $$
 \begin{pmatrix}
 x_{0}&x_{1}&x_{2}\\
  x_{1}&x_{3}&x_{4}\\
   x_{2}&x_{4}&x_{5}\\
\end{pmatrix}
,
$$
which arises from the multiplication table of
\belowdisplayskip-\baselineskip
$$
H^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{2}}(1)) \otimes H^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{2}}(1)) \to H^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{2}}(2)).
$$
\end{fact}

\vspace*{3pt}

\begin{corollary}\label{forms vanishing on the RNC}
The dimension of the degree $n$ part of the homogeneous ideal of the
rational normal curve
\index{rational normal curve}%
of degree $d$ is
$$
H^0(\sI_{C/\PP^d}(n)) = \mbinom{n+d}{n} - (nd+1).
$$
In particular
the $\tbinom{d}{ 2}$ minors of the matrix $M$ are linearly independent.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The
homogeneous coordinate ring
\index{homogeneous coordinate ring}%
of the rational normal curve is
$$\CC[s,t]_{(d)}\subset \CC[s,t].$$
Comparing the dimension
of $\CC[x_0,\dots,x_d]_n$ with the dimension of $\CC[s,t]_{nd}$ gives the result.
\end{proof}

The number of quadrics containing the
rational normal curve
\index{rational normal curve}%
is extremal:
\index{extremal number of quadrics}%
\index{number!of quadrics containing the rational normal curve}%

\begin{proposition}\label{rnc on most quadrics}
If $C \subset \PP^d$ is any irreducible, nondegenerate curve, then
$$
h^0(\cI_{C/\PP^d}(2)) \leq  \mbinom{d}{2}.
$$
Equality holds only if
$C$ is a rational normal curve.
\unif
\end{proposition}

In the proof we will use a general fact about hyperplane sections:
\index{hyperplane section}%

\begin{proposition}\label{arbitrary hyperplane}
If $\,X\subset \PP^r$ is a nondegenerate, reduced, irreducible variety,
then $H^0(\sI_X(1)) = H^1 (\sI_X) = 0$.
Moreover if $H$ is any hyperplane of $\PP^r` `$, defined by
a linear form $h$, then the natural
sequence
$$
0\to \sI_{X/\PP^r} \ruto {\ h} \sI_{X/\PP^r}(1)\to \sI_{(H\cap X)/H}(1)\to 0
$$
arising from the restriction of the ideal sheaf $\sI_{X/\PP^r}$ to $H$ is exact, and the subscheme
$H\cap X$ spans $H$; that is, $H^0(\sI_{(H\cap X)/H}(1)) = 0$.
\unif
\end{proposition}

See Exercise~\ref{arbitrary hyperplane examples} for the necessity of the hypotheses
and Exercise~\ref{restriction of ideals} for a generalization.

\begin{corollary}\label{minimal degree bound}
If $X\subset \PP^r$ is a nondegenerate, reduced, irreducible variety of codimension $c$, then $\deg X \geq c+1$.
\unif
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
 The intersection of $X$ with a general plane $\Lambda$ of dimension $c$ is a finite scheme spanning $\Lambda$.
\unif
\end{proof}
%Note that
%${H\cap X}$ could have embedded components of dimension $<\dim X -1$, though in the case where $X$ is a curve
%this is obviously impossible.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{arbitrary hyperplane}]
Since
$X$ is reduced, irreducible and  \null nondegenerate,
$h$ is a nonzerodivisor modulo
$\sI_{X/\PP^r}@$, so $h\sI_{X/\PP^r} = (h)\cap \sI_{X/\PP^r}$ where
$(h) = h\sO_{X}$.
Setting $\Gamma = {H\cap X}$
we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sI_{X/\PP^r}(1)/h\sI_{X/\PP^r} &= \sI_{X/\PP^r}(1)/((h)\cap\sI_{X/\PP^r})\\
 &=(\sI_{X/\PP^r}(1)+(h))/(h)\\
 &= \sI_{\Gamma/H}(1),
\end{aligned}
$$
from which the exactness assertion follows.

 Again because $X$ is reduced and irreducible, $H^0(\sO_X)$ contains only the constant function, so the map $H^0(\sO_{\PP^r}) \to H^0(\sO_X)$ is surjective,
from which it follows that $H^1(\sI_{X/\PP^r}) = 0$. From the long exact sequence in cohomology it follows that
 the restriction map $H^0(\sI_{X/\PP^r}(1))\to H^0(\sI_{\Gamma/H}(1))$ is surjective. Since
$X$ is nondegenerate, $H^0(\sI_{X/\PP^r}(1)) = 0$, and the desired result follows.
\unif
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{rnc on most quadrics}]
Consider the restriction of the quadrics containing $C$ to a general hyperplane $H \cong \PP^{d-1} \subset \PP^d` `$, and let $\Gamma = H \cap C$. There is an exact sequence:
$$
0 \to \cI_{C/\PP^d}(1) \to \cI_{C/\PP^d}(2) \to \cI_{\Gamma/\PP^{d-1}}(2) \to 0.
$$
Proposition~\ref{arbitrary hyperplane} shows that $h^0(\cI_{C/\PP^d}(1)) = h^1(\cI_{C/\PP^d}(1))=0$, so $\Gamma$
imposes the same number of conditions on quadrics as $C$ does.

Proposition~\ref{arbitrary hyperplane} also shows that $H$ is the
\vadjust{\allowbreak}%
linear span of  $\Gamma$.
Therefore
the hyperplane section $\Gamma$ of $C$ must contain at least $d$
linearly independent points (this gives another proof that
such a curve must have degree $\geq d$.)
Any set of linearly independent points imposes independent conditions on linear forms, and thus also on quadrics (see
Proposition~\ref{min hilb} for a stronger result).
Thus
$$
h^0(\cI_{\Gamma/\PP^{d-1}}(2)) \leq h^0(\cO_{\PP^{d-1}}(2)) - d =
\mbinom{d+1}{2} - d = \mbinom{d}{2},
$$
establishing the desired inequality.

To prove that
equality can be achieved only with the rational normal curve,
suppose that $C\subset \PP^{d}$
is not a rational normal curve, so that $\deg C >d$. Let
$$
\Gamma' \subset H \cong \PP^{d-1}
$$
be a subset
of $d$ linearly independent points of a general hyperplane section $H\cap C$
and let $\Gamma = \Gamma'\cup\{p\}\subset H$ be a subset containing one more point.

We will
show that $p$ imposes a nontrivial vanishing condition on quadrics containing $\Gamma'$, since
then $C$
will lie
on fewer quadrics than the rational normal curve.
Since the points of $\Gamma'$ are linearly independent, each subset of
$d{-}1$ of them spans a $(d{-}2)$-plane inside $H$, and the intersection
of these spans is empty. Thus one of the spans $\Lambda$ does not
contain $p$.
The union of  a general hyperplane $H$ containing $\Lambda$ and a general hyperplane containing
the point $\Gamma' \setminus \Gamma'\cap \Lambda$
is a quadric containing $\Gamma'$ but not $p$, as required.
\unif
\end{proof}

For each $m$, rational normal curves lie on more hypersurfaces of
degree $m$ than any other irreducible, nondegenerate curve in $\PP^d$;
see Exercise~\ref{extremal m-ics}.

\subsubsection*{Rational normal curves are projectively homogeneous}

An
important property of rational normal curves $C \subset \PP^d$
is that they are \emph{projectively homogeneous},
in the sense that the
subgroup $G\subset\PGL_{d+1}$ of automorphisms of $\PP^d$ that carry
$C$ to itself acts transitively on $C$. More generally:
\index{projectively homogeneous}%

\begin{proposition}\label{Veronese is projectively homogeneous}
If $@X\subset \PP^n$ is the image of $\,\PP^r$ by the Veronese map
\index{Veronese!map!is projectively homogeneous}%
\index{projectively homogeneous}%
associated
to $|\sO_{\PP^r}(d)|$, then $X$ is projectively homogeneous.
\unif
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
$\PP^r$
itself
is a homogeneous variety
in that $\Aut \PP^r$ acts transitively.
For any
automorphism
$\sigma$ of $\PP^r$, we have
$\sigma^*\cO_{\PP^r}(d) = \cO_{\PP^r}(d)$
because $\cO_{\PP^r}(d)$ is the unique
invertible sheaf of degree $d$ on $\PP^r$;
thus
$\sigma$ induces an automorphism $\phi$ on $H^0(\cO_{\PP^r}(d))$
and an automorphism $\bar \phi$ on the ambient space
$\PP^{N} \colonequals \PP H^0(\cO_{\PP^r}(d))$ of the target of the $d$-th Veronese map. If $\ell \in H^0(\cO_{\PP^r}(d))$
 with divisor $D\subset X$, then $\phi(\ell) = \ell \circ \sigma$ has divisor $\sigma^{-1}(D)$, so $\bar\phi^{-1}$ induces $\sigma$ on $\PP^r` `$.
\unif
\end{proof}

The
rational normal curve
\index{rational normal curve}%
$C \subset \PP^d$ can  be characterized among irreducible,
nondegenerate curves as the unique projectively homogeneous curve in
$\PP^d$ (Corollary~\ref{uninflected curves}).

\subsubsection*{%
Interpolation
for rational normal curves}
\index{interpolation!of $d+3$ points}%

Another
striking
property of rational normal curves is expressed in
the following
proposition.
Recall that a collection of points (or a finite subscheme)
of $\PP^d$ is
\emph{in linearly general position}
if no $k{+}1$ of them lie in a $(k{-}1)$-plane with $k\leq n$.

\begin{proposition}\label{points on rnc}
\index{linearly general position}%
Any $d+3$ points $p_1,\dots, p_{d+3} \in \PP^d$
in linearly general position
lie on a unique rational normal curve $C \subset \PP^d$.
\unif
 \end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
There is an automorphism $\Phi : \PP^d \to \PP^d$ carrying
$p_1,\dots,p_{d+1}$ to the coordinate points
$(0,\dots,0,1,0,\dots,0)\in \PP^d$ and the point $p_{d+2}$ to the
point $(1,1,\dots,1)$.  Denote the image of the remaining  point
$p_{d+3}$  by $[\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_n]$. We consider maps $\PP^1 \to
\PP^d$ given in terms of an inhomogeneous coordinate $z$ on $\PP^1$ by
$$
z \mapsto \left( \frac{1}{z - \nu_0}, \frac{1}{z - \nu_1} , \dots, \frac{1}{z - \nu_d}  \right)
$$
with $\nu_0,\dots,\nu_d$ any distinct scalars. Clearing denominators,
we see that the image of such a map is a rational normal curve, and it
passes through the $d+1$ coordinate points of $\PP^d` `$, which are
the images of the points $z = \nu_0, \dots, \nu_d \in \PP^1` `$.
Moreover, the image of the point  at infinity is $(1,1,
\dots,1)$. Because the points are assumed linearly independent, the
$\alpha_i$ must all be nonzero, and thus if we take  $\nu_i =
-1/\alpha_i$, the image of the point $z = 0$ is
$(\alpha_0,\dots,\alpha_d)$. This proves existence; we leave
uniqueness to Exercise~\ref{Castelnuovo uniqueness}.
\unif
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}
A generalization of Proposition~\ref{points on rnc} is given, with a proof that is different
even in our case, in \cite[Proposition 3.19]{Montreal}.  There is also a version replacing the set of $d+3$ distinct points by a  finite
scheme of degree $d+3$ satisfying necessary conditions, in \cite{EHLGP}.
\end{fact}

Given some ``natural''
family of curves in projective space $\PP^r$ (such as an open set of smooth
curves in a component of the Hilbert scheme
described in Chapters
\ref{ModuliChapter} and \ref{HilbertSchemesChapter})
and an integer $m$, we can ask whether there exists a curve in the
family passing through $m$ given general points of $\PP^r` `$.
Proposition~\ref{points on rnc}
gives the only example we know of curves other than complete
intersections for which there is a \emph{unique} such curve.

\section{Other rational curves}

What about other rational curves in projective space?

Any linear series $\cD$ of degree $d$ on $\PP^1$ is a subseries of the complete series $|\cO_{\PP^1}(d)|$, so any map $\phi : \PP^1 \to \PP^r$ of degree $d$ may be given as the
composition of the embedding $\phi_d : \PP^1 \to \PP^d$ of $\,\PP^1$
as a rational normal curve with a linear projection $\pi : \PP^d \to
\PP^r` `$. Since the natural degree $d$
Veronese embedding
\index{Veronese!map}%
of $\PP^1 =
\PP(V)$ as the rational normal curve is the map
$\PP V \to \PP(\Sym^d(V))$, the projection is a map into $\PP W` `$, where $W\subset \Sym^d(V)$.

\begingroup \let\;\,
We can make this more explicit in several ways: first, choosing a basis $s,t$ for $V$ and a basis of forms $F_i$ of degree $d$ on $\PP^1$ for $W` `$, we may write the map as
$$
(s,t) \; \mapsto \; \left(F_0(s,t), \dots, F_r(s,t)\right).
$$
If the $F_i$ have a greatest common factor $G(s,t)$ then the set $G=0$ will be the base locus
of the linear series, and the map
$$
(s,t) \; \mapsto \; \left( \frac{F_0(s,t)}{G(s,t)}, \dots, \frac{F_r(s,t)}{G(s,t)}\right).
$$
gives the same map, represented as a linear series of lower degree $d-\deg G$. Thus we
will now assume that the forms in $W$ have no common factor.

Perhaps
more simply,
we can pass to an open affine
$\AA^1\subset\PP^1$
given by $t=1$,
with coordinate function $z = s/t$, and
dehomogenize the $F_i$ to get a vector space of polynomials $f_i = F(s,1)$ of degree $\leq d$. Then we may write the
map as
$$
z \; \mapsto \; (f_0(z), \dots, f_r(z)).
$$
Since the $F_i$ have no common factor, and
thus
are not all divisible by $t$, at least one of the
$f_i$ will have degree exactly $d$.
For example, the twisted cubic itself can be represented by the map
$z \mapsto (1, z,z^2,z^3)$.

Here, we think of a polynomial $f(z) = f(s/t)$ of degree $\leq\ d$
as a rational function on $\PP^1$ having
a pole of order at most $d$ at the point at infinity $(1,0)\in \PP^1`$; but we could also take rational
functions $F_i(s,t)/G_i(s,t)$ of total degree $\deg F_i-\deg G_i = d$ or, dehomogenizing, $\phi_i(z) = f_i(z)/g_i(z)$.
\endgroup

\subsection*{Smooth rational quartics}

Given how easy it is to describe rational curves in projective space
\index{rational quartic}%
\index{quartic curve!rational}%
in this way, it is surprising how many open questions there are. We
begin with
one of the simplest cases: a smooth nondegenerate rational curve $C$ of degree $4$ in $\PP^3` `$.
As described above, such a curve is the image of $\PP^1$ under a map given by 4 quartic forms,
or, in the most coordinate-free formulation, a codimension 1 subspace of $\Sym^4(V)$, where
$V\cong \CC^2` `$.

\begin{example}
In Exercise~\ref{distinguishing rational quartics} the reader
is asked to
prove that there is a 1\hbox{-}parameter family of
$\PGL_4$ orbits of smooth rational quartic curves in $\PP^3` `$.
Perhaps the simplest is given by the parametrization
$$
\PP^1 \ni (s,t) \mapsto (s^4, s^3t, st^3, t^4)\in \PP^3,
$$
or, more simply, $t\mapsto(t, t^3, t^4)$.

Proposition~\ref{ideal of rational quartic} shows that the homogeneous
ideal of this curve requires~4 generators, and it is not hard to show
that the ideal is generated scheme theoretically (that is, up to saturation) by 3 elements. Nevertheless it is
one of the most famous open problems in the theory of curves to determine whether or not the ideal
is generated up to radical by just 2 elements\emdash that is, whether it
can be written
\emph{set-theoretically}
\index{set-theoretic equality}%
as the intersection of two surfaces. For a sample of the recent
work on this, see \cite{MR3356940}.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}\label{ideal of rational quartic}
If $C\subset \PP^3$ is a smooth rational quartic curve, then $C$ lies on a smooth quadric
surface $S$ in the divisor class $(1,3)$, and the homogeneous ideal of $C$ is minimally
generated by the quadric defining $S$ and three cubic forms.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We first consider the restriction maps
$$
\rho_e: H^0(\op3e)\to H^0(\cO_C(e)).
$$
Since $C\cong \PP^1` `$,
we may identify $H^0(\cO_C(e))$ with
$H^0(\op1{4e})$.
 Since we assume that $C$ is nondegenerate, it does not lie on a hyperplane,
 so  $\rho_1$ is a monomorphism.

The source $H^0(\op32)$ of $\rho_2$ is 10-dimensional, and the target $H^0(\op18)$ is
9-dimensional, so $\rho_2$ has a kernel of dimension at least 1; that is, $C$ lies on
a quadric surface, and since $C$ is irreducible and nondegenerate, any quadric surface containing
$C$ is irreducible. This quadric is smooth;
see Example~\ref{curve on rank 3 quadric}.

%If $C$ lay on a second quadric surface, then, since the quadrics must be irreducible,
%$C$ would be contained in the complete intersection of the two, which also has degree 4, so
%$C$ would be the complete intersection of the two quadrics. But by adjunction such a curve would have genus 1, so this can't be the case (indeed, we'll encounter such curves in the next section, when we take up curves of genus 1).

Given that $C$ lies on a smooth quadric surface $Q$, we consider its divisor class $(a,b)$ in the
Picard group $\Pic(Q) = \ZZ\oplus \ZZ$. As we saw in Example~\ref{curves on quadrics}, a smooth curve
in the class $(a,b)$ has degree $a+b$ and genus $(a{-}1)(b{-}1)$;
solving the equations $a+b=4$
and
$(a{-}1)(b{-}1)=0$ we see that $C\sim (1,3)$ or $C\sim (3,1)$. Since the cases
are symmetric we assume $C\sim(1,3)$.

The source of $\rho_3$ is 20-dimensional and the target is
13-dimensional so there are at least 7
cubics in the ideal of $C\subset \PP^3` `$. Four of these come from multiplying the quadric
by the 4 variables on $\PP^3` `$, so there are at least 3 more cubic generators in $I_{C/\PP^3}$,
 the homogeneous ideal of $C$.

From the exact sequence
$$
0\to I_{Q/\PP^3} \to I_{C/\PP^3} \to I_{C/Q} \to 0
$$
we see that $I_{C/\PP^3}$ is generated by the form defining the quadric
together with generators for $I_{C/Q}$. Moreover,
the natural inclusion $I_{C/Q}\subset H^{0}_{*}(I_{C/Q})$ is an equality; this follows from the exact sequence of sheaves
$$
0\to \sI_{Q/\PP^3} \to \sI_{C/\PP^3} \to \sI_{C/Q} \to 0
$$
because $H^{1}_{*}(\sI_{Q/\PP^3}) = H^{1}_{*}(\sO_{\PP^3}(-2)) = 0$.
Thus we need only compute generators for $H^{0}_{*}(I_{C/Q})$.

Since $C$ lies in class $(1,3)$ we see that
$$
\sI_{C/Q}(d) = \cO_{\PP^1\times \PP^1}(d{-}1, d{-}3)
.
$$
By the K\"unneth formula,
$$
h^0(\sI_{C/Q}(3)) = h^0(\cO_{\PP^1\times \PP^1}(2, 0)) = h^0(\op12)\cdot h^0(\op10) = 3,
$$
and we see that $I(C)$ contains just 3 cubic generators modulo the quadric defining $Q$.

We claim that the three generators of $h^0(\cO_{\PP^1\times \PP^1}(2, 0))$ generate all of
$$
H^0_{*}(\sI_{C/Q}(3)) = H^0_{*}(\cO_{\PP^1\times \PP^1}(2, 0)) =
\tsty
\bigoplus\limits_{m\geq 0}H^{0}(\cO_{\PP^1\times \PP^1}(m+2,m)).
$$
For this we must show that the maps
$$
\rho_{m}: H^{0}(\op31) \otimes H^0(\sI_{C/Q}(m+3)) \to H^0(\sI_{C/Q}(m+1+3))
$$
are surjective for $m\geq 0$.

Since the restriction
of $H^0(\op31)$ to the quadric is
$$
H^0(\sO_{\PP^1\times \PP^1}(1,1)) = H^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{1}}(1)) \otimes H^{0}(\sO_{\PP^{1}}(1)),
$$
the map $\rho_{m}$
is the tensor product of the two maps
$$
H^{0}(\op11)\otimes H^{0}(\op1{m+2}) \to H^{0}(\op1{m+1+2})
$$
and
$$
H^{0}(\op11)\otimes H^{0}(\op1{m}) \to H^{0}(\op1{m+1})
,
$$
both of which are surjective for $m\geq 0$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Some open problems about rational curves}

We can say far less about rational curves of higher degree, even in $\PP^3` `$. For example, when $d$ is large, we
don't know the possible Hilbert functions for curves of degree $d$ in $\PP^3` `$, and the situation in $\PP^r$ for
$r>3$ is even worse. However, we do know the Hilbert function of a \emph{general} rational curve $C \subset \PP^r$ of degree $d$.

Since such statements will come up often, we pause to explain
exactly what it means to say
\index{general@a general X has property Y}%
``A general X has property Y.'' This
statement presupposes a choice of a parameter space for objects of
type X,
that is to say, an algebraic variety $Z$ whose points each correspond to an object of type X. Thus, to be precise, the statement should be,
``An  object of type X that is general with respect to parameter space $Z$ has property Y.'' The statement then means: inside $Z$ there is
a dense open set whose elements correspond to objects of type X that have property Y. Often $Z$ is irreducible, and
then it is enough to have a nonempty open set, since every such set is Zariski dense.

In the case of nondegenerate rational curves
of degree $d$ in $\PP^{r}$
we could take for $Z$ the space of
$(r@{+}1)$-tuples of independent elements of $H^{0}(\op1d)$, or
equivalently, taking the quotient by $\PGL(r+1)$,
the
Grassmannian
\index{Grassmannian}%
 of $(r@{+}1)$-dimensional planes in $H^{0}(\op1d)$.
We will later make statements about general curves of genus $g$, referring either to
a component of a Hilbert scheme
(discussed in Chapter \ref{ModuliChapter}) or to the
moduli space of curves that is discussed at length in Chapter
\ref{CurvesModuliChapter}.

As in Proposition~\ref{ideal of rational quartic}, knowing the Hilbert function of a curve $C\subset \PP^{r}$ is tantamount to knowing the ranks of the restriction maps
$$
\rho_m : H^0(\cO_{\PP^r}(m)) \to H^0(\cO_C(m)) = H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(md)).
$$
Equivalently we ask: if $V$ is a general  $(r+1)$-dimensional vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$, what is the dimension of the space of polynomials spanned by $m$-fold products of polynomials in $V$?

We might guess that the answer is, ``as large as possible,'' meaning
that the rank of $\rho_m$ is $\tbinom{m+r}{r}$ or $md+1$,
whichever is less
\emdash in
other words, the map $\rho_m$ is either injective or surjective for
each $m$. This was proved in \cite{Ballico-Ellia83}, and is a special
case of Larson's maximal rank theorem \cite{Larson}.

As we will see in subsequent chapters it is possible to speak of a
\index{general curve of genus $g$}%
general curve of genus $g$
and a
\index{general invertible sheaf}%
general invertible sheaf
of degree $d$ on such a curve; and the analogous statement
about Hilbert functions  was proven in \cite{Larson}; 
see Chapter~\ref{Brill--Noether}.

Nevertheless, even the degrees of the generators of the homogeneous ideal of a general
rational curve of degree $d$ in $\PP^3$ is unknown for larger $d$.

\subsubsection*{The secant plane conjecture}

If $C \subset \PP^r` `$, then an $e$-secant $s$-plane to $C$ is an
$s$-plane $\Lambda \cong \PP^s \subset \PP^r$ such that the
intersection $\Lambda \cap C$ has degree $\geq e$.
\index{secant plane conjecture}%

Should you expect a curve $C \subset \PP^r$ to have any $e$-secant
$s$-planes? The set of $s$-planes in $\PP^r$ is parametrized by the
Grassmannian
\index{Grassmannian}%
$\GG = \GG(s,r)$, which has dimension $(s+1)(r-s)$. Inside $\GG$, the locus of planes that meet $C$ has codimension $r-s-1$ (reason: the locus of planes containing a given point $p$ is isomorphic
by projection from $p$ to $\GG(s-1,r-1)$, and thus has codimension $r-s$).
Thus one might conjecture that a curve $C \subset \PP^r$
will have $e$-secant $s$-planes when
\vspace*{-3pt}
$$
e \; \leq \; (s+1)\frac{r-s}{r-s-1},
$$
perhaps with a few low-degree exceptions. Is this true of a general rational curve? For most $e$, $r$ and $s$, we don't know.

\section{The Cohen--Macaulay property}\label{ACM}

In Section~\ref{rational normal curves section} we defined a curve
$C\subset \PP^{r}$ to be arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay (ACM) if the
\index{Cohen--Macaulay}%
natural maps
$$
\rho_m: H^0(\sO_{\PP^r}(m)) \to H^0(\sO_{C}(m))
$$
are surjective for all $m$. When this is the case we can accurately predict the number of independent forms of
each degree vanishing on the curve, and the condition has other important consequences that we will explore here and in Chapters~\ref{LinkageChapter} and \ref{SyzygiesChapter}. For general treatments of
Cohen--Macaulay rings see \cite[Chapter 18]{Eisenbud1995} or the book \cite{BrunsHerzog}. One of the characterizations of the condition is in terms of regular sequences:
\index{regular sequence}%

\begin{definition}\label{gradeDef}
A sequence of elements $f_{1}, \dots, f_{c}$ in a ring $R$ is
\emph{regular}
if
$f_{i+1}$ is a nonzerodivisor modulo $(f_{1}, \dots, f_{i})$ for $i = 0,\dots, c-1$ and the ideal
$(f_{1}, \dots, f_{c})$ is not the unit ideal.

The
\emph{grade}
\index{grade!of an ideal}%
of an ideal $I$ in a ring  $R$ (sometimes called the
depth
\index{depth!of an ideal}%
of $I$ on $R$) is the maximal length of a regular sequence contained
in $I$, or $\infty$ if $I = R$.

A local ring $(R,\gm)$ is \emph{Cohen--Macaulay} if $\grade \gm = \dim
R$.
A Noetherian ring
$R$ is called Cohen--Macaulay if
every localization is Cohen--Macaulay.
Likewise,
a scheme is Cohen--$`$Macaulay if
all its local rings are Cohen--Macaulay.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
 \item The sequence of elements $x_{0},\dots, x_{r}\subset S\colonequals \CC[x_{0}\dots, x_{r}]$ is regular, proving
 from the definition that the localization of $S$ at the homogeneous maximal ideal is Cohen--Macaulay.

 \item
Regular local rings
\index{regular local ring}%
are Cohen--Macaulay. Thus every
smooth scheme
\index{smooth scheme}%
is Cohen--Macaulay, and in particular
$S\colonequals \CC[x_{0}\dots, x_{r}]$ is Cohen--Macaulay.

 \item It follows from the definition that any
\index{complete intersection}%
complete intersection in a Cohen--Macaulay scheme is again Cohen--Macaulay.
Thus every plane curve, and more generally every complete intersection curve,
\index{ACM}%
is ACM; and we shall show in Section~\ref{CastelnuovoSection} that every canonically embedded curve
and every curve embedded by a complete linear series of sufficiently high degree is also ACM.

\item
Zero-dimensional rings
are all Cohen--Macaulay. The set of
zerodivisors in a Noetherian ring is the union of the
\index{associated prime}%
\index{prime!associated}%
associated primes of 0, so a
1-dimensional ring
is Cohen--Macaulay if and only if
\index{zero-dimensional ring}%
\index{1-dimensional ring}%
it is pure-dimensional (sometimes called
``unmixed'')
\emdash that is,
\index{unmixed ring}%
\index{pure-dimensional}%
every associated prime ideal is 1-dimensional.
Thus any purely 1-dimensional scheme is Cohen--Macaulay.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begingroup \manyfacts
\begin{fact}
 \item We defined the
\index{grade}%
grade as the maximal length of a regular sequence in $I$; but in fact
all
\index{maximal regular sequence}%
maximal regular
sequences have the same length, equal to the smallest integer $k$ such that
$\smash{\Ext^{k}(R/I,R)}\neq 0$
\cite[Theorem 17.4 and Proposition 18.4]{Eisenbud1995}.

\item For any proper ideal $I\subsetneq R$ we have $\grade I \leq \codim I$. On the other hand, if $R$ is Cohen--Macaulay,
then $\grade I =\codim I$ for every ideal $I$ of $R$. In this sense the grade is an arithmetic
approximation to the codimension.

\item Every localization of a Cohen--Macaulay ring is Cohen--Macaulay. If $X\subset \PP^{r}$
has homogeneous coordinate ring $R_{X}$, then we say that $X\subset \PP^{r}$ is
arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay
\index{arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay!variety}%
if $R_{X}$ is Cohen--Macaulay, a property that depends on the
embedding, and implies the intrinsic property that $X$ is Cohen--Macaulay (since the local rings
of $X$ are essentially localizations of $R_{X}$). Previously we defined a curve $C\subset \PP^{r}$
to be arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay if the natural map $R_{C}\to H^{0}_{*}(\sO_{C})$ is surjective.
We will prove that this is equivalent to $R_{C}$ being Cohen--Macaulay in Proposition~\ref{ACM basics}. The same definitions and theorem apply to a positively graded ring, and homogeneous ideals.

\item By
Serre's criterion
\index{Serre's criterion}%
\cite[Section 11.2]{Eisenbud1995} the homogeneous coordinate ring
$R_C$ of a curve $C$ is
normal
\index{normal ring}%
(that is, integrally closed)
if and only if
$C$ is both nonsingular and ACM, and sometimes $C$ is said to be
\index{projectively normal}%
\emph{projectively normal} in this case.  (This is also the excuse for
the terminology
``linearly normal''
\index{linearly normal}%
\index{quadratically normal}%
for a curve embedded by a complete linear series,
quadratically normal
if $\rho_{2}$ is surjective, and so on.)
\end{fact}
\endgroup

\begin{proposition}\label{ACM basics}
Suppose that $C\subset \PP^r$ is a 1-dimensional subscheme. Let $S = H^0_*(\sO_{\PP^r})$
be the homogeneous coordinate ring of $\PP^r` `$, and let $R_C = S/I_C$ be the homogeneous
coordinate ring of $C$. The following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}

 \item The natural injective map $R_C \to H^0_*(\sO_{C}(1))$ is surjective.

\item $H^1_*(\sI_{C/\PP^r}) = 0$.

\item The homogeneous coordinate ring $R_C$ of $C$ is a Cohen--Macaulay ring; that is, there are linear forms $h,h'$ on $\PP^r$ whose images in  $R_C$ form a regular sequence. In particular, $R_C$ has no $0$-dimensional primary components,
so $C$ is purely $1$-dimensional and thus Cohen--Macaulay as a scheme.
\index{Cohen--Macaulay!scheme}%

 \item For every hyperplane $H\subset \PP^r$ that does not contain any component of $C$,
 the homogeneous ideal of $H\cap C$
 is equal to  $I_C+(h)$, where $h$ is a linear form defining $H$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\def\sl#1{(#1)}
\let\rTo\to
\let\Leftrightarrow\iff
{\sl 1} $\Leftrightarrow$ {\sl 2}: We may assume that $r\geq 2$, so $H^1_*(\sO_{\PP^r}(n)) = 0$ for all $n$. Using this and the exact sequence
$
0\rTo \sI_{C/\PP^r}  \rTo  \sO_{\PP^r}  \rTo  \sO_C  \rTo  0
$
we see that $H^0(\sO_{\PP^r}(n)) \to H^0(\sO_C(n))$ is surjective for all $n$ if and only if $H^1(\sI_{C/\PP^r}(n)) = 0$ for all $n$,
proving the equivalence of {\sl 1} and {\sl 2.}

{\sl 1} $\Leftrightarrow$ {\sl 3}: First let $C\subset \PP^r$ be an arbitrary 1-dimensional subscheme,
and let $R =H^0_*(\sO_{C}) \colonequals \bigoplus_{n\in \ZZ} H^0(\sO_{C}(n))$.
If $H$ is a
general hyperplane, with equation $h=0$, then $h$ does not vanish on any primary component of $C$, and thus the sequence
$$
0\rTo \sO_C(-1) \ruto{\ h}\sO_C\rTo \sO_{C\cap H}\rTo 0
$$
is exact. Applying $H^0_*$ and using
(2),
we see that $h$ is a nonzerodivisor on $R$, and that $R/hR$ is
a subring of $H^0_*(\sO_{C\cap H})$.  A general linear form $h'$ doesn't vanish on
any point of $C\cap H$, so $h'$ is a unit on $H^0_*(\sO_{C\cap H})$
and thus a nonzerodivisor on $R/hR$.

The ring $R_C$ is the image of the natural map $S\to R$, and by definition $C$ is ACM if and only if this map is surjective,
so that $R_C = R$. This shows that if $C$ is arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay then $R_C$ is a Cohen--Macaulay ring,
and is in particular unmixed; that is, $C$ has no 0-dimensional primary components (see for example \cite[Chapter 18]{Eisenbud1995} for general
information about Cohen--Macaulay rings). This proves the equivalence of conditions {\sl 1} and {\sl 3.}


{\sl 3} $\Leftrightarrow$ {\sl 4}: If  $h$ does not vanish on any component of $C$ then $h$ is a nonzerodivisor on $R_C$. The ideal $I_{C\cap H}$ is in any case the saturation of $I_C+(h)$.
If $I_{C\cap H}=I_C+(h)$, then any linear form $h'$ not containing a point of $C\cap H$ is a nonzerodivisor
on $I_C+(h)$, so $C$ satisfies condition {\sl 2}. Conversely, in a 2-dimensional positively graded Cohen--Macaulay ring, any
system of parameters is a regular sequence \cite[Section 18.2]{Eisenbud1995}, so $I_C+(h)$ is unmixed, and in particular, saturated.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}\label{meaning of ACM}
The Cohen--Macaulay property is hard to interpret geometrically; the definition is justified by its usefulness. Here are two results that help our intuition:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A scheme $X$ is Cohen--Macaulay if some (equivalently every) finite map $f: X\to P$ to a smooth scheme $P$
of the same dimension is
\index{flat!map}%
flat, or equivalently the pushforward $f_*(\sO_X)$ is locally free. (This follows
from the
Auslander--Buchsbaum formula
\index{Auslander--Buchsbaum formula}%
\cite[Section 19.3]{Eisenbud1995}.)
\item (Hartshorne) If a scheme $X$ is Cohen--Macaulay then $X$ is
\index{connected in codimension 1}%
connected in codimension 1
(that is, $X$ remains connected after removing any
closed subset of codimension $\geq 2$).
See
\cite[Theorem 18.12]{Eisenbud1995} for a proof.

show that a general $g^3_4$ on $\PP^1$ is uniquely expressible as a sum of the $g_1^1$ and a $g^1_3$

\begin{exercise}\label{rnc and representations}
Let $V = \CC\cdot e_1\oplus \CC\cdot e_2$ be a 2-dimensional vector space.

The group $\SL_2= \SL (V)$ acts on the
rational normal curve
\index{rational normal curve}%
of degree $d$ through automorphisms induced from its action on
\index{SL@$\SL_n, \,\SL(V)$!representation theory of}%
\index{Sym@$\Sym(V)$, $\Sym^d(V)$, $\Sym^e(V)$}%
the ambient space $\PP^d$ of the rational normal curve, which may be identified with $\PP(\Sym^d(V))$.

In \cite[pp.\,146--150]{Fulton-Harris} it is shown that
 every finite-dimen\-sional rational
representation of $\SL(V)$ is a direct sum of representations of the
form $\Sym^e(V)$ for various $e\geq 0$.
There it is explained that to understand how a given representation decomposes one should look at the action of the
torus generator
\index{torus generator}%
$$
\alpha \colonequals \biggl(\begin{matrix}
t&0\\
0&t^{-1}
\end{matrix}
\biggr)
\in \SL(V).
$$
The eigenvectors of $\alpha$ are called the {\it weight vectors} of the representation.
\index{weight vector}%
Note that $\Sym^e(V)$ is spanned by the weight vectors
$w_s \colonequals e_1^{e-s} e_2^{s}$
that satisfy $\alpha w_s = t^{e-2s}$ for $s = 0, \dots e$.
To decompose an arbitrary representation $W` `$, knowing that $W$ is a direct sum of $\Sym^{e_i}V` `$, it is enough to know the
\index{Sym@$\Sym(V)$, $\Sym^d(V)$, $\Sym^e(V)$}%
eigenvalues for the action of $\alpha$: We begin by finding an element $w\in W$ that
is an eigenvector of $\alpha$ and transforms by $\alpha$ as $\alpha w
= t^mw$ with the highest possible $m$ (this is called a ``highest
weight vector'').
Such a $w$
must be contained
in a summand $\Sym^m(V)$, and after removing the eigenvalues of the action of $\SL_2$ on $\Sym^m(V)$, we continue.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Use this method to show that
\index{Sym@$\Sym(V)$, $\Sym^d(V)$, $\Sym^e(V)$}%
\begin{align*}
 \Sym^d(V)\otimes \Sym^d(V)&= \Sym^{2d}(V) \oplus  \Sym^{2d-2}(V) \oplus \Sym^{2d-4}(V) \otimes\cdots,\\
 \Sym^2(\Sym^d(V))&= \Sym^{2d}(V) \oplus \Sym^{2d-4}(V)\oplus \Sym^{2d-8}(V)\otimes \cdots,\\[-1.5pt]
 \mwedge^2(\Sym^d(V))&= \Sym^{2d-2}(V) \oplus \Sym^{2d-6}(V)\oplus \Sym^{2d-10}(V)\otimes \cdots,
\end{align*}
where we take $\Sym^{m}(V)=0$ when $m<0$.
 \item Show that the space of quadrics containing the rational normal curve is a representation of $\SL_2$ of the form
 $$
 \Sym^{2d-4}(V)\oplus \Sym^{2d-8}(V) \cdots
 $$
  \item Show  there is a distinguished nonsingular
\index{skew-symmetric form}%
\index{twisted cubic}%
skew-symmetric form (up to scalars) on the ambient space of the twisted cubic.
Thus a twisted cubic in $\PP^3$ determines, for each point of $\PP^3` `$, a distinguished plane containing that point.
 \item Show that if $d$ is divisible by 4 there is a distinguished quadric in the ideal of the rational normal curve.
\end{enumerate}
