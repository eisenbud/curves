``Es gibt nach des Verf. Erfarhrung kein besseres Mittel, Geometrie zu lernen, als
das Studium des Schubertschen `Kalk\"uls der abz\"ahlenden Geometrie'.''

(There is, in the author's experience, no better means of learning geometry than
the study of Schubert's ``Calculus of Enumerative Geometry.")

--B. L. van der Waerden (in a Zentralblatt review of an introduction to enumerative geometry
by Hendrik de Vries).

%{\bf 1066 \& All That} (\cite{1066}) is ``A memorable history of England, comprising all the parts you can remember, including one hundred and three \emph{good} things, five \emph{bad} kings, and two \emph{genuine} dates\dots. History is not what you thought. \emph{It is what you can remember.}

%``In the year 1066 occurred the other memorable date in English History, viz. \emph{William the Conquereor, Ten Sixty-six.} 
%This is also called \emph{The Battle of Hastings,} and was when William I (1066) conquered England at the Battle of Senlac (\emph{Ten Sixty-six})\dots 
%The Norman Conquest was a Good Thing, as from this time onwards England stopped being conquered and thus was able to become top nation.''

\section{What's in this book}


\begin{quote}

We are dealing here with a fundamental and almost paradoxical difficulty. Stated briefly, it is that learning is sequential but knowledge is not. A branch of mathematics... consists of an intricate network network of interrelated facts, each of which contributes to the understanding of those around it. When confronted with this network for the first time, we are forced to follow a particular path, which involves a somewhat arbitrary ordering of the facts.

--Robert Osserman.

Where to begin? To start with the technical underpinnings of a subject risks losing the reader before the point of all that preliminary work is made clear; but to defer the logical foundations carries its own dangers---as the unproved assertions mount up, the reader may well feel adrift.

Intersection theory poses a particular challenge in this regard, since the development of its foundations is so demanding. It is possible, however, to state fairly simply and precisely the main foundational results of the subject, at least in the limited context of intersections on smooth projective varieties. The reader who is willing to take these results on faith for a little while, and accept this restriction, can then be shown ``what the subject is good for," in the form of examples and applications. This is the path we've chosen in this book, as we'll now describe.

\subsection{Overture}



\subsection{Relation of this book to Other texts} 
Chapter IV of~\cite{Hartshorne1977} has a similar flavor to that of this book, and indeed we will take a familiarity with the material of that text as effectively a pre-requisite.
There are more elementary accounts of some of that material in~\cite{ Fulton **** } and \cite{Walker} as well as the notes of~\cite{Griffiths***}; and a far more comprehensive treatment in \cite{ACGH}. The Riemann surface point of view is well represented in the books \cites{Forster} \cite{Gunning} \cite{Kirwan}\cite{Miranda}Though the existence of the moduli spaces of curves is in the background of this book whenever we speak of ``general'' curves of given genus, we say only a little about it; many more ideas and details about it can be found in~\cite{Harris-Morrison}, though even that is not a complete account.


\section{Prerequisites, notation and conventions}

We will assume familiarity, though not much technical information, with coherent sheaves and their cohomology though some of this theory, and that of divisors on projective 
varieties, is reviewed in Appendix 2. It is probably enough if the reader can write down $H^1$ and H^0$ and exact sequences without blushing, and in any case we redo some of what is in~\cite[Chapter IV]Hartshorne1977}  Chapter IV in our language. We also use a few basic facts about surfaces from the first two sections of ~\cite[Chapter IV]{Hartshorne1977}.

The reader should also be familiar with the (Krull) dimension of rings and varieties, and their primary decomposition at the level of \cite{Atiyah-MacDonald}, including localization and with Lasker's often mis-attributed theorem that complete intersections are unmixed (the version for forms in 3 variables was proven by
Max Noether, and is now often called the $AF+BG" theorem.)

We are all familiar with the after-the-fact tone---weary, self-justificatory, aggrieved, apologetic---shared by ship captains appearing before boards of inquiry to explain how they came to run their vessels aground, and by authors composing forewords.
