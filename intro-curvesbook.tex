the study of Schubert's ``Calculus of Enumerative Geometry.")

\section{Why you want to read this book}

Algebraic geometry is an old subject. You could make the case that it dates back to Descartes, whose introduction of coordinates in the plane and in space made it possible to relate the algebra of polynomials to the geometry of their zero loci; in any event, mathematicians have been doing what is recognizably algebraic geometry for more than two centuries.

And within algebraic geometry, the study of algebraic curves is naturally the oldest topic. After all, the study of polynomials in two variables via their zero sets is the first nontrivial case of the general paradigm of algebraic geometry. Moreover, the theory of algebraic curves received a tremendous boost in the 19th century from the work of mathematicians studying complex analysis, from the introduction of the notion of Riemann surfaces in **** on.

What all this has meant is that the subject of algebraic curves is one of the richest in algebraic geometry, if not in all of mathematics. Examples abound; if you want to know whether a given hypothesis holds, you can almost always find well-understood special cases that will allow you to test it. And some of the fundamental constructions of algebraic geometry, like the construction of moduli spaces and their description, can be carried out in the setting of algebraic curves with a degree of precision and detail far beyond what has been possible (so far!) in higher dimensions. 

By way of one example, consider the relatively simple case of plane curves of degrees 3 and 4. In degree 3, a smooth plane cubic will have 9 flexes---points where the tangent line has contact of order 3 with the curves---and these points form a remarkable configuration; they're the only known example of a finite, non-colinear set of points in the plane such that the line joining any two contains a third. And generalizing the notion of the flexes of a plane cubic leads us to the subject of inflectionary behavior of linear series on curves in general, a fascinating topic and one that has played a role as a tool in the proof of fundamental theorems. And in degree 4, we see that every smooth quartic curve has exactly 28 bitangents, forming a beautiful and mysterious configuration (for example, there are **** 4-tuples of bitangents such that their eight points of tangency with the curve lie on a conic!). Moreover, extending this to curves of higher genus leads us to the rich theory of theta-characteristics, bringing together algebra (in the form of a bilinear pairing on the points of order 2 in the Jacobian of a curve), analysis (in the form of theta-functions) and of course projective geometry.

The richest subject in what is arguably the richest branch of mathematics\footnote{Number theorists may quibble}---of course you want to read this book! 

\section{Why we wrote this book}

The wealth of beauty, both in theory and in examples, certainly makes the study of algebraic curves an attractive prospect. But it comes at a price: to absorb in detail all the things we've learned over the centuries about algebraic curves would take years, if not decades. This is, in essence, the conundrum facing anyone who undertakes to write a book on the subject: how to convey the wealth of our knowledge of the subject without writing an encyclopedia.

For better or worse, this is our attempt to do exactly that.

\section{What's in this book}


\begin{quote}
\small\sf
We are dealing here with a fundamental and almost paradoxical difficulty. Stated briefly, it is that learning is sequential but knowledge is not. A branch of mathematics... consists of an intricate network  of interrelated facts, each of which contributes to the understanding of those around it. When confronted with this network for the first time, we are forced to follow a particular path, which involves a somewhat arbitrary ordering of the facts.

--Robert Osserman.

Where to begin? To start with the technical underpinnings of a subject risks losing the reader before the point of all that preliminary work is made clear; but to defer the logical foundations carries its own dangers---as the unproved assertions mount up, the reader may well feel adrift.

Intersection theory poses a particular challenge in this regard, since the development of its foundations is so demanding. It is possible, however, to state fairly simply and precisely the main foundational results of the subject, at least in the limited context of intersections on smooth projective varieties. The reader who is willing to take these results on faith for a little while, and accept this restriction, can then be shown ``what the subject is good for," in the form of examples and applications. This is the path we've chosen in this book, as we'll now describe.

\subsection{Overture}



\subsection{Relation of this book to Other texts} 
Chapter IV of~\cite{Hartshorne1977} has a similar flavor to that of this book, and indeed we will take a familiarity with the material of that text as effectively a pre-requisite.
There are more elementary accounts of some of that material in~\cite{ Fulton **** } and \cite{Walker} as well as the notes of~\cite{Griffiths***}; and a far more comprehensive treatment in \cite{ACGH}. The Riemann surface point of view is well represented in the books \cite{Forster} \cite{Gunning} \cite{Kirwan}\cite{Miranda}Though the existence of the moduli spaces of curves is in the background of this book whenever we speak of ``general'' curves of given genus, we say only a little about it; many more ideas and details about it can be found in~\cite{Harris-Morrison}, though even that is not a complete account.


\section{Prerequisites, notation and conventions}

We will assume familiarity, though not much technical information, with coherent sheaves and their cohomology though some of this theory, and that of divisors on projective 
varieties, is reviewed in Appendix 2. It is probably enough if the reader can write down $H^1$ and $H^0$ and exact sequences without blushing, and in any case we redo some of what is in~\cite[Chapter IV]{Hartshorne1977}  Chapter IV in our language. We also use a few basic facts about surfaces from the first two sections of ~\cite[Chapter IV]{Hartshorne1977}.

The reader should also be familiar with the (Krull) dimension of rings and varieties, and their primary decomposition at the level of \cite{Atiyah-MacDonald}, including localization and with Lasker's often mis-attributed theorem that complete intersections are unmixed (the version for forms in 3 variables was proven by
Max Noether, and is now often called the $AF+BG$ theorem.)
