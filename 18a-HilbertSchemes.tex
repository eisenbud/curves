\chapter{Hilbert Schemes}
\label{HilbertSchemesChapter}

In earlier Chapters, we described some  degree $d$ embeddings curves of  genus $g$ in projective spaces $\PP^r$ for small $g,r,d$. In this chapter, we will try to describe the \emph{restricted Hilbert scheme} $\cH^\circ_{g,3,d}$, 
which is an open subscheme of $Hilb_{dm-g+1}(\PP^3)$. See Examples~\ref{Hilb for plane curves} and \ref{Hilb for plane curves-continued} for the (deceptively simple) Hilbert scheme of plane curves. 

Three basic questions about the schemes $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\bullet$] Is $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ irreducible? 
\item[$\bullet$]  What is its dimension (or the dimensions of its components)?
\item[$\bullet$] Where is it smooth, and where is it singular?
\end{enumerate}

Of course, there are many more questions about the geometry of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$: for example,  what is the closure $\overline{\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}} \subset \cH_{g,r,d}$ in the whole Hilbert scheme? (In other words, when is a subscheme $X \subset \PP^r$ with Hilbert polynomial $dm-g+1$ \emph{smoothable}, in the sense that it is the flat limit of a family of smooth curves?) 


\section{Degree 3}

The first case to consider is that of the Hilbert scheme  $\cH_{0,3,3}$. The corresponding restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ_{0,3,3}$, parameterizing twisted cubics, is one we have encountered and described times already: in Proposition~\ref{hilb of twisted cubics} we showed that $\cH^\circ_{0,3,3}$ is irreducible of dimension 12,
and we gave another proof, based on linkage, in Chapter~\ref{LinkageChapter}. 
By Exercise~\ref{twisted cubic normal bundle}, the normal bundle of a twisted cubic $C$ is $\sN_{C/\PP^3}=\sO_{\PP^1}(5)\oplus \sO_{\PP^1}(5)$
so by Theorem~\ref{tangent space of Hilb} the tangent space to the Hilbert scheme at $C$ is
$H^0(\sN_{C/\PP^3}) = \CC^{12}$, so $\cH_{0,3,3}$ is smooth at this point.

In $\cH_{0,3,3}$ we can also see a phenomenon common in Hilbert schemes: the presence of extraneous components.

\subsection{The other component of $\cH_{0,3,3}$}

We might naively expect that the closure $\overline{\cH^\circ}$ would be all of $\cH$, but this is not the case:  $\cH$ has two irreducible components, one the closure of $\cH^0$.

To describe the second (``extraneous'') component, suppose we start with a plane cubic curve $C_0 \subset \PP^2 \subset \PP^3$. This is of course a curve of degree 3, but its Hilbert polynomial is $p(m) = 3m$ rather than $3m+1$, reflecting the fact that the genus of $C_0$ is 1, not 0.

But that can be fixed: adding any point $p \in \PP^3 \setminus C_0$ to $C_0$ has the effect of increasing the Hilbert polynomial by 1, so that the Hilbert polynomial of $C := C_0\cup \{p\}$ is $3m+1$. Thus $C$  corresponds to a point of $\cH_{0,3,3}$. In fact, the locus in $\cH_{0,3,3}$ of curves $C$ of this form is open, and its closure is a second irreducible component of $\cH$. 


\begin{theorem}
$\cH_{0,3,3}$ has two irreducible components. One is 12-dimensional with generic point corresponding to  a twisted cubic,
while the other is 15-dimensional with generic point corresponding to the union of a smooth plane cubic and a point outside the plane.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $C'$ be the purely 1-dimensional scheme defined by the intersection of the primary ideals in the decomposition of $I_C$ that correspond to
components of dimension 1. If the hilbert polynomials of $C$ and $C'$ are $p(m)$ and  $p'(m)$ then
$p(m) \geq p'(m)$ for all large $m$; equality for large $m$ would imply that $C'=C$.

Since $\deg C' = \deg C = 3$, the curve $C'$ is either irreducible or the union of two or three irreducible components. In the first case $C'$ is either nondegenerate, in which case it is a twisted cubic by Theorem~\ref{characterization of P1} and $C' = C$; or a plane cubic. If $C'$ is a plane cubic, then it has Hilbert function $3m$, so $\sI_{C'}/\sI_C$
corresponds to a point in $\PP^3$, either embedded in $C'$ or not. Such a union is specified by the choice of the
plane, the cubic in it, and the point\footnote{if the point is an embedded point, one must check that every possibility
is a limit of points off the curve} , and thus has dimension $3 + 9+3 = 15.$

On the other hand, if $C$ is not planar and not irreducible, then $C'$ consists of 3 lines or the union of a (planar) conic
and a line not in the plane. In this case each connected component has arithmetic genus 0 and thus Hilbert polynomial
with constant term 1; so the curve must be connected. All such curves can be realized as divisors of type $(1,2)$
on a quadric, and thus have Hilbert function equal to that of $C$, whence again $C' = C$.
\end{proof}

\pict{degeneration of a twisted cubic to a plane cubic with embedded point at the node (copy from 
Schemes book. also show the generic point of the extraneous component}


\begin{fact}
In \cite{Piene-Schlessinger} it is also shown that the two components of $\cH_{0,3,3}$ are smooth and rational, that
their their intersection is  smooth and rational of dimension 11.
\end{fact}

The phenomenon described here---the presence of components of the Hilbert scheme whose general member is not smooth, irreducible and nondegenerate---is in fact not exceptional; in the following section we'll describe ``extraneous components" more generally. Before we move on, though, there is one aspect of the geometry of $\cH_{0,3,3}$ that is special: the action of the group $PGL_4$ on $\cH_{0,3,3}$ has only finitely many orbits (If you want to see the orbits in the principle component $\overline{\cH^\circ}$, see~\cite{Montreal}) It's not known if there are other examples of this, beyond Grassmannians, Hilbert schemes of quadric hypersurfaces and Hilbert schemes of triples of points. See also the discussion in Section~\ref{rigid?}of the existence of ``rigid curves;" that is, curves $C \subset \PP^r$ corresponding to points in the Hilbert scheme $\cH_{md-g+1}$ whose $PGL_{r+1}$ orbit is open.

\section{Extraneous components}

 Let $\cH_d(\PP^r)$ be the Hilbert scheme of subschemes of $\PP^r$ with Hilbert polynomial the constant $d$, with open subset $\cH^\circ_d(\PP^r)$ whose points correspond to reduced $d$-tuples of points in $\PP^r$. This open subset is the complement of the diagonal in the $d$th symmetric power of $\PP^r$. We call the closure of this open set the \emph{principal component} of $\cH_d(\PP^r)$. It has dimension $dn$.

Iarrobino in \cite{Iarrobino1985} first proved that, for any $n \geq 3$ and any sufficiently large $d$, there are components of $\cH_d(\PP^n)$ having dimension strictly larger than $dn$; see Exercise~\ref{bigger component}. There are also examples of extraneous components
of dimension $<dn$; see~\cite{MR2579394}. No one knows how many irreducible components the Hilbert scheme $\cH = \cH_d(\PP^n)$ has, or what their dimensions might be.

This in turn infects the Hilbert schemes of curves. For example, the Hilbert scheme $\cH_{3,r,d}$ has a component whose general point corresponds to a union of a plane curve of degree $d$ and $\binom{d-1}{2} - g$ points; moreover, if $\Gamma$ is any irreducible component of the Hilbert scheme of zero-dimensional subschemes of degree $\binom{d-1}{2} - g$ in $\PP^3$, there is a component of $\cH_{g,3,d}$ whose  general point corresponds to a union of a plane curve of degree $d$ and the subscheme corresponding to a general point of $\Gamma$. Further, we can replace the plane curves in this construction with any component of the Hilbert scheme of curves of degree $d$ and genus $g' > g$. There can also be components of $\cH_{d,r,3}$ whose general point corresponds to a subscheme of $\PP^3$ with a spatial embedded point---see~\cite{Chen-Nollet}.

Bottom line: it's a mess. For many $g,d$ the Hilbert scheme $\cH_{g,3,d}$ has many components. In most cases no one knows how many, or what their dimensions are. 

\section{Degree 4}

By Clifford's Theorem or Castelnuov's bound, an irreducible nondegenerate curve of degree 4 in $\PP^{3}$ must have genus 0 or 1; we consider these cases in turn.

\subsection{Genus 0}\label{degree 4 genus 0}

We can deal with rational quartics by a slight variant of the first method we used to deal with twisted cubics. A rational curve of degree 4 is the image of a map $\phi_F : \PP^1 \to \PP^3$ given by a four-tuple $F = (F_0,F_1,F_2,F_3)$ with $F_i \in H^0(\cO_{\PP^1}(4))$. The space of all such four-tuples up to scalars is a projective space of dimension $4 \times 5 - 1 = 19$; let $U \subset \PP^{19}$ be the open subset of four-tuples such that the map $\phi$ is a nondegenerate embedding. We then have a surjective map $\pi : U \to \cH^\circ$, whose fiber over a point $C$ is the space of maps with image $C$. Since any two such maps differ by an automorphism of $\PP^1$---that is, an element of $\PGL_2$---the fibers of $\pi$ are three-dimensional; we conclude that $\cH^\circ_{0,3,4}$ is irreducible of dimension 16. 

The same analysis can be used on rational curves of any degree $d$ in any projective space $\PP^r$: the space $U$ of nondegenerate embeddings $\PP^1 \to \PP^r$ of degree $d$ is an open subset of the projective space $\PP^{(r+1)(d+1)-1}$ of $(r+1)$-tuples of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ on $\PP^1$ modulo scalars; and the fibers of the corresponding map $U \to \cH^\circ_{dm+1}$ are copies of $\PGL_2$. This yields the

\begin{proposition}\label{dimension of rational curves}
The open set $\cH^\circ_{0,r,d}$ parametrizing smooth, irreducible nondegenerate rational curves $C \subset \PP^3$ is irreducible of dimension $(r+1)(d+1)-4$; in case $r=3$ in particular it has dimension $4d$.
\end{proposition}

In contrast to the case of twisted cubics, smooth rational curves in $\PP^r$ of the same degree may have different normal bundles. This gives an interesting stratification of the restricted Hilbert scheme of rational curves; see \cite{MR3778979} for a discussion.

\subsection{Genus 1}
 As we saw in Section~\ref{g=1 in P3,P4}, a quartic curve $C \subset \PP^3$ of genus 1 is the intersection of two quadric surfaces, and by Lasker's theorem, every quadric containing $C$ is a linear combination of those two. Conversely, the intersection of two general quadrics in $\PP^3$ is a quartic curve of genus 1. We can thus construct a family of quartics of genus 1: let $V = H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(2))$ be the 10-dimensional vector space of homogeneous quadric polynomials in $\PP^3$ and $G(2,V)$ the Grassmannian of 2-planes in $V$, and consider the incidence correspondence
$$
\Gamma = \{ (\Lambda, p) \in G(2,V) \times \PP^3 \mid F(p)=0 \; \forall \; F \in \Lambda \}.
$$
The fiber of $\Gamma$ over a point $\Lambda \in G(2,V)$ is thus the base locus of the pencil of quadrics represented by $\Lambda$; let $B \subset G(2,V)$ be the Zariski open subset over which the fiber is smooth, irreducible and nondegenerate of dimension 1. By the universal property of Hilbert schemes, the family $\pi_1 : \Gamma_B \to U$ induces a map $\phi : B \to \cH^\circ$ that is one-to-one on points; it follows that the reduced subscheme of $\cH^\circ_{1,3,4}$ is birational to an open subset of the Grassmannian $G(2,10)$, and we conclude that $\cH^\circ_{1,3,4}$ is irreducible of dimension 16. Exercise~\ref{hilb 1,3,4} shows that this map is actually an isomorphism.

The  argument  here---where we constructed a family $\cC \to B$ of curves of given type, and then invoked the universal property of the Hilbert scheme to get a map $B \to \cH$---is typical in analyses of Hilbert schemes. 

\section{Degree 5}

Let $C \subset \PP^3$ be a smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate quintic curve of genus $g$. By Clifford's theorem the bundle $\cO_C(1)$ must be nonspecial, so  by the Riemann-Roch theorem we must have $0\leq g \leq 2$. We have already seen that the space $\cH^\circ_{0,3,5}$ of rational quintic curves is irreducible of dimension 20. We will treat the case $g=2$ in detail, and leave the case $g=1$ as an exercise. This case will be covered in a different way in Section~\ref{estimating dim hilb}.

\subsection{Genus 2}

We have considered curves of genus 2 in Section~\ref{genus 2 section}.  Recall that a curve of genus 2 and degree 5 in 
$\PP^3$ is contained in the intersection of a unique quadric surface $Q$ and a cubic surface $S$ not containing $Q$.
The intersection $Q\cap S$
has degree 6, and is thus the union of $C$ and a line. If $Q$ is smooth then, in terms of the isomorphism $Q \cong \PP^1 \times \PP^1$, the curve $C$ is a divisor of type $(2,3)$ on the quadric $Q$. Note that conversely if $L \subset \PP^3$ is a line and $Q$ and $S \subset \PP^3$ are general quadric and cubic surfaces containing $L$, and if we write
$$
Q \cap S = L \cup C
$$ 
then the curve $C$ is a curve of type $(2,3)$ on the quadric $Q$ and hence, by the adjunction formula,
 a quintic of genus 2.

This suggests two ways of describing the family $\cH^\circ_{2,3,5}$ of such curves. First, we can use the fact that $C$ is linked to a line to make an incidence correspondence
$$
\Psi = \{ (C, L, Q, S) \in \cH^\circ \times \GG(1,3) \times \PP^9 \times \PP^{19} \; \mid \; Q \cap S = C \cup L \},
$$
where the $\PP^9$ (respectively, $\PP^{19}$) is the space of quadric (respectively, cubic) surfaces in $\PP^3$. Given a line $L \in \GG(1,3)$, the space of quadrics containing $L$ is a $\PP^6$, and the space of cubics containing $L$ is a $\PP^{15}$; thus the fiber of the projection $\pi_2 : \Psi \to \GG(1,3)$ over $L$ is an open subset of $\PP^6 \times \PP^{15}$, and we see that \emph{$\Psi$ is irreducible of dimension $4 + 6 + 15 = 25$}.

On the other hand, the fiber of $\Psi$ over a point $C \in \cH^\circ_{2,3,5}$ is an open subset of the $\PP^5$ of cubics containing $C$; and we conclude that $\cH^\circ_{2,3,5a}$ is irreducible of dimension $20$.


Another approach to describing the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ_{2,3,5}$ would be to use the fact that the quadric surface $Q$ containing a quintic curve $C \subset \PP^3$ of genus 2 is unique. We thus have a map
$$
\cH^\circ \to \PP^9,
$$
whose fiber over a point $Q \in \PP^9$ is the space of quintic curves of genus 2 on $Q$. 

The problem is, the space of quintic curves of genus 2 on a given quadric $Q$ is not in general irreducible: for a general, and thus smooth quadric $Q$ it consists of the disjoint union of the open subsets of smooth elements in the two linear series of curves of type $(2,3)$ and $(3,2)$ on $Q$, each of which is a $\PP^{11}$. We can conclude immediately that $\cH^\circ$ is of pure dimension 20; to conclude that it is irreducible we use the fact that in the family of all smooth quadric surfaces, the monodromy exchanges the two rulings (Example~\ref{monodromy of rulings}).

For the case of quintics of genus 1, see Exercise~\ref{quintics genus 1}.

\section{Degree 6}

Again the Clifford and Riemann-Roch theorems suffice to compute the possible genera of a curve of degree 6. To start with,  if the line bundle $\cO_C(1)$ is nonspecial, then by the Riemann-Roch theorem we have $g \leq 3$. Suppose on the other hand that $\cO_C(1)$ is special. Since   $h^{0}(\cO_C(1)) \geq 4$, we have equality in Clifford's theorem, and either $C$ is hyperelliptic and $\cO_C(1)$ is a multiple of the $g^{1}_{2}$ or  $C$ is  a canonically embedded curve of genus 4. The first case cannot occur, since no special series on a hyperelliptic curve is very ample; thus $C$ must be a canonical curve of genus 4. Thus a smooth irreducible, nondegenerate curve of degree 6 in $\PP^3$ has genus at most 4.


The cases of genera 0, 1 and 2 are covered under Proposition~\ref{nonspecial Hilbert} below, leaving us the cases $g = 3$ and 4. Both are well-handled by the Cartesian approach of describing their ideals.

\subsection{Genus 4}

As we've seen in Section\ref{canonical genus 4} a canonical curve of genus 4 is the complete intersection of a (unique) quadric $Q$ and a cubic surface $S$. We thus have a map
$$
\alpha : \cH^\circ_{4,3,6} \rTo \PP^9
$$
sending a curve $C$ to the quadric $Q$ containing it. Moreover, the fibers of this map are open subsets of the projective space $\PP V$, where $V$ is the quotient
$$
V = \frac{H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3))}{H^0(\cI_{Q/\PP^3}(3))}
$$
of the space of all cubic polynomials modulo cubics containing $Q$. Since this vector space has dimension 16, the fibers of $\alpha$ are irreducible of dimension 15, and we deduce that \emph{the space $\cH^\circ_{6m-3}$ is irreducible of dimension 24}.
See Exercise~\ref{second complete intersection exercise} for the generalization to arbitrary smooth complete intersections in $\PP^3$.

\subsection{Genus 3}
We leave this to the reader in Exercises~\ref{6,3:1}, \ref{6,3:2}


\section{Degree 7}

Using the tools above, we invite the reader to show that each component of the restricted Hilbert schemes of curves of degree 7
in $\PP^3$ has expected dimension 28. See Exercise~\ref{degree 7 analysis} for an outline.


The sharp-eyed reader will have noticed that in, every case analyzed so far,  the Hilbert scheme
$\cH^\circ_{g,3,d}$ parametrizing smooth curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\PP^3$ has dimension $4d$. 
 This is the ``expected dimension'',  in a sense we will now make precise:
 
\section{The expected dimension of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$}\label{chi N}

Let $C\subset \PP^r$ be a smooth curve of genus $g$ and degree $d$. In Section~\ref{tan hilbert section}
we computed the tangent space to $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ at the point $[C]$ as $H^0(\sN_{C/\PP^r})$, so 
the dimension $h^0( \sN_{C/\PP^r})$ is an upper bound for $\dim \cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$. We can compute a lower bound as well:


\begin{fact}\label{deformation bound}
 The Hilbert scheme is representable, so
the completion of the local ring $(R,\gm)$ of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ at the point $[C]$ representing a smooth curve can, in principle, be computed by deformation theory.
Though this can actually be carried out in small cases, it is hard to get much qualitative information from the process
except for two numbers: the dimension of the tangent space, which we have already computed as 
$$
t:= (\gm/\gm^2)^*  = H^0(N_{C/\PP^r})
$$
and the number of generators of the ideal $J$ that is the kernel of a surjection  $\CC[[ x_1,\dots, x_t]] \to R$
is $\leq h^1( \sN_{C/\PP^r}) $ (a similar result holds for any subscheme of $\PP^r$ that is locally a complete intersection)
\cite[Corollaries 6.2.5, 6.4.11 and Proposition 6.5.2]{MR2223408}. 

Thus 
$$
\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) \leq \dim (\cH^\circ_{g,r,d})\leq h^0(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) \hbox{ locally at } [C].
$$
If the upper bound is achieved, then $[C]$ is a smooth point of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$, and if the lower bound is achieved
then the local ring of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ at $[C]$ is a complete intersection (in which case the
$[C]$ is again a smooth point.
\end{fact}

For a nonspecial embedding, the two estimates above agree, and 
the number $\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r})$ is something we can compute:

\begin{theorem}\label{nonspecial Hilbert}
 If $C$ is a smooth curve of genus $g$and degree $d$ in $\PP^r$ then
 $$
 \chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) = (r+1)d - (r-3)(g-1).
 $$
 Moreover, when $C$ is embedded by a nonspecial linear series, this is the local dimension
 of the Hilbert scheme at the point $[C]$; and therefor if $d>2g-2$,
 there is only one component of the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$.
\end{theorem}

Note that in the case of $\PP^3$ we have $\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) = 4d$, and we have
seen that when $d\leq 7$ this is always equal to the dimension of the restricted hilbert
scheme, whether or not the embedding special. In view of this,
we define the \emph{expected dimension} of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ to be
$$
h(g,r,d) := (r+1)d - (r-3)(g-1).
$$
We will give yet another argument for calling this the expected dimension in Section~\ref{estimating dim hilb}.

\begin{proof} 
 From the exact sequence
$$
0 \to T_C \to \sT_{\PP^r}|_C \to \sN_{C/\PP^r} \to 0
$$
we see that $\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) = \chi(\sT_{\PP^r}|_C) - \chi(\sT_C)$
and that if $H^1( \sT_{\PP^r}|_C) = 0$ then $\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) = h^0(\sN_{C/\PP^r}).$
Since $\sT_C = \omega_C^{-1}$, the Riemann-Roch theorem gives $\chi(\sT_C) = -3g+3$.

To compute $\chi(\sT_{\PP^r}|_C)$ we restrict the Euler sequence
$$
0\to \sO_{\PP^r} \to \sO_{\PP^r}(1)^{r+1} \to \sT_{\PP^r} \to 0
$$
to $C$.
Using the Riemann-Roch theorem again we deduce that
$$
\chi( \sT_{\PP^r} ) = (r+1)\chi(\sO_C(1)) - \chi(\sO_C) = (r+1)(d-g+1) - (1-g) = (r+1)d + r(1-g)
$$
From the restriction of the sequence above we also see that
if $\sO_C(1)$ is nonspecial then $H^1(\sT_{\PP^r}\mid_C) = 0$.

Putting these values together, we get
$
\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) = (r+1)d - (r-3)(g-1)
$
as required.

For the statements about  nonspecial embeddings, we could invoke the deformation theory argument
in~\ref{deformation bound}, since in this case $h^1(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) = 0$, and the upper and lower estimates
coincide. However, we can give an argument invoking only the existence of the relative Picard scheme from
Chapter~\ref{JacobianChapter}.
If $\sO_C(1)$ is nonspecial, then the
nonspecial invertible sheaves of degree $d$ on curves of genus $g$
 form an open subset of the $3g-3+ g$-dimensional relative Picard scheme. The dimension
 of the space of sections is $d-g+1$, so the family of $r$-dimensional linear series associated to
 each invertible sheaf is the dimension of the Grassmannian, $\dim G(r+1, d-g+1) = (r+1)(d-g-r)$,
 and the choice of a basis of the linear series, up to scalars, adds $(r+1)^2-1 = \dim PGL_{r+1}$. 
 Thus the dimension of  $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ near $[C]$ is
$$
3g-3+ g + (r+1)(d-g-r) + (r+1)^2-1 = (r+1)d - (r-3)(g-1)
$$
as required. If $d>2g-2$, then every curve in $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ is nonspecial, completing the proof.
\end{proof}

The natural question is, does this hold in general; and if it doesn't, can we say in what range it does?

Such arguments apply more generally to the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ$ of smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curves in $\PP^r$. 

\section{Open problems}\label{open problems}


\subsection{Rigid curves?}

In the last section, we considered components of the restricted Hilbert scheme whose image in $M_g$ was ``as small as possible." Let's go now all the way to the extreme, and ask: is there a component of the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ whose image in $M_g$ is a single point? (Of course $M_0$ itself is a single point, so we exclude genus 0.) We can give three flavors of this question, in order of ascending preposterousness.

\begin{enumerate} 
\item First, we'll say a smooth, irreducible and nondegenerate curve $C \subset \PP^r$ is \emph{moduli rigid} if it lies in a component of the restricted Hilbert scheme whose image in $M_g$ is just the point $[C] \in M_g$---in other words, if the linear series $|\cO_C(1)|$ does not deform to any nearby curves.

\item Second, we say that such a curve is \emph{rigid} if it lies in a component $\cH^\circ$ of the restricted Hilbert scheme such that $PGL_{r+1}$ acts transitively on $\cH^\circ$. This is saying that $C$ is moduli rigid, plus the line bundle $\cO_C(1)$ does not deform to any other $g^r_d$ on $C$.

\item Finally, we say that such a curve is \emph{deformation rigid} if the curve $C \subset \PP^r$ has no nontrivial infinitesimal deformations other than those induced by $PGL_{r+1}$---in other words, every global section of the normal bundle $\cN_{C/\PP^r}$ is the image of the restriction of a vector field on $\PP^r$.
\end{enumerate}

In truth, these are not so much questions as howls of frustration. The existence of irrational rigid curves seems outlandish; we don't know anyone who thinks there are such things. But then, why can't we prove that they don't exist?



\section{Degree 8, genus 9}\label{degree 8 section}

We start with an example of a component of the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ$ whose dimension is strictly greater than $h(g,r,d)$, the space $\cH^\circ_{9,3,8}$ of smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curves in $\PP^3$ of degree 8 and genus 9. Let $C$ be such a curve, and consider the restriction map
$$
\rho_2 : H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(2)) \rTo H^0(\cO_C(2)).
$$
The source of $\rho_2$ has dimension 10, but the Riemann-Roch Theorem
\begin{align*}
h^0(\cO_C(2)) =
\begin{cases}
9, \quad &\text{if } \cO_C(2) \cong K_C; \\
8,  \quad &\text{if } \cO_C(2) \not\cong K_C
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
admits two possibilities for the dimension of target of $\rho_2$.
However, if $h^0(\cO_C(2))$ were 8 then $C$ would  lie on two distinct quadrics $Q$ and $Q'$. Since $C$ is nondegenerate, it cannot lie on any irreducible quadrics; thus $Q$ and $Q'$ would have to be irreducible, which would violate B\'ezout's Theorem. We deduce that $\cO_C(2) \cong K_C$, and thus that $C$ lies on a unique quadric surface $Q$ (which must be irreducible since $C$ is irreducible and doesn't lie on a plane).

Similarly, $C$ cannot lie on any cubic not containing $Q$. Moving on to quartics, we look again at the restriction map
$$
\rho_4 : H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(4)) \rTo H^0(\cO_C(4)).
$$
The dimensions here are, respectively, 35 and $4\cdot 8 - 9 + 1 = 24$; and we deduce that $C$ lies on at least an 11-dimensional vector space of quartic surfaces. On the other hand, only a 10-dimensional vector subspace of these vanish on Q; and so we conclude that $C$ lies on a quartic surface not containing $Q$. It follows from B\'ezout's Theorem that $C = Q \cap S$. By Lasker's Theorem, the ideal $(Q,S)$ is saturated, so it is equal to the homogeneous ideal of $C$. Thus $\ker(\rho_4)$ has dimension exactly 11, and  $S$ is unique modulo quartics vanishing on $Q$.

From these facts it is easy to compute the dimension of  $\cH^\circ_{9,3,8}$: Associating to $C$ the unique quadric on which it lies gives a map $\cH^\circ_{9,3,8} \to \PP^9$ with dense image, and each fiber is an open subset of the projective space $\PP V$, where $V$ is the 25-dimensional vector space
$$
V = \frac{H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(4))}{H^0(\cI_{Q/\PP^3}(4))}.
$$
By Exercise~\ref{hilb at a ci}, $\cH^\circ_{9,3,8}$ is generically smooth, as well.

In sum, we have proven:
\begin{proposition}
 The scheme $\cH^\circ_{9,3,8}$ of curves of genus  is generically smooth and irreducible of dimension 33---one larger than the ``expected'' $4d$.
\end{proposition}

This is a special case of Exercise~\ref{second complete intersection exercise}.

\subsection{Brill-Noether in low codimension}
 
In Section~\ref{degree 8 section} we saw an example of a component of the Hilbert scheme with larger than ``expected'' dimension, and it's not hard to produce lots of similar examples: components of the Hilbert scheme that parametrize complete intersections, or more generally determinantal curves, have in general dimension larger than $h(g,r,d)$, and Exercise~\ref{many large components} gives a way of generating many more.

 But observations suggest a possible pattern: perhaps components of $\cH^\circ$ whose image in $M_g$ have low codimension still have the expected dimension $h(g,r,d)$. 

The cases with codimension $\leq 2$ are already known: In~\cite{BrillNoether-1}, it is shown that if $\Sigma \subset M_g$ is any subvariety of codimension 1, then the curve $C$ corresponding to a general point of $\Sigma$ has no linear series with Brill-Noether number $\rho < -1$; and Edidin in ~\cite{Edidin} proves the analogous (and much harder) result for subvarieties of codimension 2. Moreover, among the examples we know of components of the Hilbert scheme whose dimension is strictly greater than the expected $h(g,r,d)$, there are none whose image in $M_g$ has codimension less than $g-4$. We could therefore make the conjecture:

\begin{conjecture}
If $\cK \subset \cH^\circ_{d,g,r}$ is any component of a restricted Hilbert scheme, and the image of $\cK$ in $M_g$ has codimension $\leq g-4$, then $\dim \cK = h(g,r,d)$.
\end{conjecture}

\subsection{Maximally special  curves} Most of Brill-Noether theory, and the theory of linear systems on curves in general, centers on the behavior of linear series on a general curve. The opposite end of the spectrum is also interesting, and we may ask: How special can a linear series on a special curve be?

To make such a question precise, let $\widetilde M^r_{g,d} \subset M_g$ be the closure of the image of the map $\phi : \cH^\circ_{d,g,r}\to M_g$ sending a curve to its isomorphism class. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the smallest possible dimension of $\cH^\circ_{d,g,r}$? 
\item What is the smallest possible dimension of $\widetilde M^r_{g,d}$?
\item Modifying the last question slightly, let $M^r_{g,d} \subset M_g$ be the closure of the locus of curves $C$ that possess a $g^r_d$ (in other words, we are dropping the condition that the $g^r_d$ be very ample). We can ask what is the smallest possible dimension of $M^r_{g,d}$?
\end{enumerate}

One might suppose that the most special curves, from the point of view of questions 2 and 3, are hyperelliptic curves but the locus in $M_g$ of hyperelliptic curves has dimension $2g-1$. What about smooth plane curves? That's better -- in the sense that the locus in $M_g$ of smooth plane curves has dimension asymptotic to $g$ (Exercise~\ref{moduli of plane curves}) -- but there are still a lot of them.


Can we do better?  Consider the locus of smooth complete intersections of two surfaces of degree $m$ in $\PP^3$. As we saw in Exercise~\ref{complete intersection open}, these comprise an open subset $\cH^\circ_{ci}$ of the Hilbert scheme of curves of degree $d = m^2$, and genus $g$ given by the relation
$$
2g-2 = \deg K_C = m^2(2m-4),
$$
or, asymptotically,
$$
g \sim m^3.
$$

Moreover, the dimension of this component of the Hilbert scheme is easy to compute, since as we saw in Exercise~\ref{first complete intersection exercise} that it is isomorphic to an open subset of the Grassmannian $G(2, \binom{m+3}{3})$, and so has dimension
$$
2(\binom{m+3}{3} - 2) \; \sim \; \frac{m^3}{3}
$$
Finally, we observe that if $C \subset \PP^r$ is a complete intersection curve of genus $g >1$, the canonical bundle $K_C$ is a positive power of $\cO_C(1)$, and by Exercise~\ref{ci is acm}  $C$ is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay.

 
For a given abstract curve $C$ there are only finitely many invertible sheaves having the canonical sheaf as a power; and since a complete intersection is necessarily given by a complete linear series, there are only finitely many embeddings of a given curve as a complete intersection, up to $PGL_{r+1}$. In other words, the fibers of $\cH^\circ_{ci}$ over $M_g$ have dimension $\dim(PGL_{r+1}) = r^2 + 2r$.

Thus, we have a sequence of components of the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ$ whose images in $M_g$ have dimension tending asymptotically to $g/3$.

Exercise~\ref{balanced CI}  suggests why we chose complete intersections of surfaces of the same degree.


More generally, we can consider complete intersections of $r-1$ hypersurfaces of degree $m$ in $\PP^r$. Such curves have
genus $g = m^{r-1}((r-1)m-r-1)/2 +1$ in a similar fashion we can calculate that their images in $M_g$ have dimension asympotically approaching $2g/r!= (m-1)(r-1)/r!$
 as $m \to \infty$, as we ask you to verify in Exercise~\ref{balanced CI in higher codim}.


The question is, can we do better? For example, if we fix $r$, can we find a sequence of components $\cH_n$ of  restricted Hilbert schemes  $\cH^\circ_{g_n,r,d_n}$ of curves in $\PP^r$ such that
$$
\lim \frac{\dim \cH_n}{g_n} \; = \; 0?
$$

%\subsection{Estimating $\dim \cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ by the Euler characteristic of the normal bundle}
%
%It is interesting to compare the estimate of  $\dim \cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ above with what we get from deformation theory. 
%Let $C\subset \PP^r$ be a smooth curve of genus $g$ and degree $d$. In Section~\ref{tan hilbert section}
%we computed the tangent space to $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ at the point $[C]$ as $H^0(\sN_{C/\PP^r})$, so 
%the dimension $h^0( \sN_{C/\PP^r})$ is an upper bound for $\dim \cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$. We can compute a lower bound as well:
%
%
%\begin{fact}
% The Hilbert scheme is representable, so
%the completion of the local ring $(R,\gm)$ of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ at the point $[C]$ representing a smooth curve can, in principle, be computed by deformation theory.
%Though this can actually be carried out in small cases, it is hard to get much qualitative information from the process
%except for two numbers: the dimension of the tangent space, which we have already computed as 
%$$
%t:= (\gm/\gm^2)^*  = H^0(N_{C/\PP^r})
%$$
%and the number of generators of the ideal $J$ that is the kernel of a surjection  $\CC[[ x_1,\dots, x_t]] \to R$
%is $\leq h^1( \sN_{C/\PP^r}) $ (a similar result holds for any subscheme of $\PP^r$ that is locally a complete intersection)
%\cite[Corollaries 6.2.5, 6.4.11 and Proposition 6.5.2]{MR2223408}. 
%
%Thus 
%$$
%\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) \leq \dim (\cH^\circ_{g,r,d})\leq h^0(\sN_{C/\PP^r}) \hbox{ locally at } [C].
%$$
%If the upper bound is achieved, then $[C]$ is a smooth point of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$, and if the lower bound is achieved
%then the local ring of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ at $[C]$ is a complete intersection (in which case the
%$[C]$ is again a smooth point.
%\end{fact}
%
%The number $\chi(\sN_{C/\PP^r})$ is something we can compute. From the exact sequence
%$$
%0 \to T_C \to T_{\PP^r}|_C \to \cN \to 0
%$$
%we deduce that
%\begin{align*}
%\deg(\cN) &= \deg(T_{\PP^r}|_C) - \deg(T_C) \\
%&= (r+1)d - (2-2g).
%\end{align*}
%
%Now we can apply the Riemann-Roch Theorem for vector bundles on curves (\cite[Theorem ???]{3264}) to conclude that
%\begin{align*}
%\chi(\cN) &= c_1(\cN) - \rank(\cN)(g-1) \\
%&= (r+1)d - (r-3)(g-1).
%\end{align*}
%
%Thus we obtain:
%\begin{theorem}
% If $C$ is a smooth curve of genus $g$ and degree $d$ in $\PP^r$ then
%\end{theorem}
%$$
%\dim \cH^\circ_{g,r,d} \; \geq \; (r+1)d - (r-3)(g-1)
%$$
%
%Proposition~\ref{nonspecial Hilbert} suggests that the ``expected dimension" of the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ$ of curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\PP^r$ should be 
%$$
%h(g,r,d) := 4g-3 + (r+1)(d-g+1) - 1.
%$$
%But the calculation immediately above suggests it should be $(r+1)d - (r-3)(g-1)$. Which is it? The answer is both: they're the same number! -- and when $r=3$ they are equal to $4d$.
%
%Thus, we have an expected dimension $h(g,r,d)$ for the restricted Hilbert scheme, and we know that in the range $d > 2g+1$, this is the actual dimension of the restricted Hilbert scheme. The natural question is, does this hold in general; and if it doesn't, can we say in what range it does? We'll take up these questions in the next chapter.

\section{Degree 9, genus 10}\label{deg9 section}

For the next example, consider the space $\cH^\circ_{9,3,10}$ of curves of degree 9 and genus 10. Once more, to describe such a curve $C$, we look to the restriction maps $\rho_m: H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(m)) \rTo H^0(\cO_C(m))$. The Riemann-Roch Theorem tells us that
\begin{align*}
h^0(\cO_C(2)) =
\begin{cases}
10, \quad &\text{if } \cO_C(2) \cong K_C \; \text{(``the first case,") and } \\
9,  \quad &\text{if } \cO_C(2) \not\cong K_C  \; \text{(``the second case.")}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Unlike the the situation in degree 8, both are possible; we'll analyze each.

1. Suppose first that $C$ does not lie on any quadric surface (so that we are necessarily in the first case above), and consider the map $\rho_3 : H^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3)) \to H^0(\cO_C(3))$. By the Riemann-Roch Theorem, the dimension of the target is $3\cdot 9 - 10 + 1 = 18$, from which we conclude that $C$ lies on at least a pencil of cubic surfaces. Since $C$ lies on no quadrics, all of these cubic surfaces must be irreducible, and it follows by B\'ezout's Theorem that the intersection of two such surfaces is exactly $C$. At this point, Lasker's Theorem assures us that $C$ lies on exactly two cubics.

By Exercise~\ref{first complete intersection exercise}, then, the space $\cH^\circ_1$ of curves of this type is thus an open subset of the Grassmannian $G(2,20)$ of pencils of cubic surfaces, which is irreducible of dimension 36. By Exercise~\ref{hilb at ci}, $\cH^\circ_1$ is generically smooth.

2. Next, suppose that $C$ does lie on a quadric surface $Q \subset \PP^3$; let $\cH^\circ_2 \subset \cH^\circ_{10,3,9}$ be the locus of such curves. In this case, we claim two things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a.] $Q$ must be smooth; and
\item[b.] $C$ must be a curve of type $(3,6)$ on $Q$
\end{enumerate}

For part (a), we claim that a smooth, irreducible nondegenerate curve $C$ of degree 9 lying on a singular quadric must have genus 12. We can see this by observing that $Q$ must be a cone over a smooth conic curve, and so its blow-up at the vertex is the Hirzebruch surface $\FF_2$, with the directrix $E \subset \FF_2$ the exceptional divisor of the blowup, and a line $L$ of the ruling of $\FF_2$ the proper transform of a line lying on $Q$. The pullback to $\FF_2$ of the hyperplane class has intersection number 1 with $L$ and 0 with $E$, from which it follows that its class must  be $H = 2L + E$

Now, the proper transform $\widetilde C$ of $C$ in $\FF_2$ has intersection number 1 with $E$, since $C$ passes through the vertex of $Q$ and is smooth there; given this, and the fact that it has intersection number 9 with $H = 2L+E$, we can deduce that the class of $\widetilde C$ is $9L + 4E$. Now, we know that $K_{\FF_2} = -2E - 4L$; by adjunction we deduce that  the genus of $C$ is 12.

For the second part, once we know that $Q$ is smooth, the genus formula on $Q$ tells us immediately that $C$ must be of type $(3,6)$ or $(6,3)$. Now, since the quadric $Q$ containing $C$ is unique, by B\'ezout, we have a map $\cH^\circ_2 \to \PP^9$ associating to each curve $C$ of this type the unique quadric containing it. The fiber of this map over a given quadric $Q$ is the disjoint union of open subsets of the projective spaces $\PP^{27}$ parametrizing curves of type $(3,6)$ and $(6,3)$ on $Q$, and we see that the locus $\cH^\circ_2$ again has dimension 36. We outline two proofs that 
$\cH^\circ_2$ is irreducible in Exercise~\ref{degree 9 type 2 is irreducible}.
We can show that $\cH^\circ_2$ is generically smooth by computing its tangent space
$H^0(\sN_{C/\PP^3}$. We start with the normal bundle sequence
$$
0\to \sN_{Q/\PP^3}\mid_C \to \sN_{C/\PP^3} \to \sN_{C/Q} \to 0
$$
and note that, by the adjunction theorem $\omega_C = \sO_Q(1,4)\mid_C$.
Thus both $\sN_{Q/\PP^3}\mid_C = \sO_Q(2,2)\mid_C$ and
$\sN_{C/Q} = \sO_Q(3,6)\mid_C$ are nonspecial, so 
$$
h^0 \sN_{C/\PP^3} = h^0(\sN_{\sO_Q(2,2)}\mid_C ) + h^0(\sO_Q(3,6)\mid_C
= 10-1 + (4*7-1) = 36
$$

In sum, we have proven:
\begin{proposition}
 The scheme $\cH^\circ_{9,3,10}$ of smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curves $C \subset \PP^3$ of degree 9 and genus 10 has two irreducible components, each generically smooth of dimension 36. One has as generic point a curve that is the complete intersections of two cubics. The generic point of the other is a curve of type $(3,6)$ on a quadric surface. \end{proposition}







\section{Estimating $\dim \cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ using the Brill-Noether theorem}\label{estimating dim hilb}

One method of estimating  the dimension of $\cH^\circ$ is a generalization of the proof of Proposition~\ref{dimension of rational curves}, with two additional wrinkles: First, since not all line bundles of degree $d$ on a curve $C$ of genus $g > 0$ are linearly equivalent, we must invoke the Picard variety $\Pic_d(C)$ parametrizing line bundles of degree $d$ on a given curve $C$, discussed in Chapter~\ref{new Jacobians chapter}. Second, since not all curves of genus $g > 0$ are isomorphic, we must involve the moduli space  $M_g$ parametrizing abstract curves of genus $g$, discussed in Chapter~\ref{Moduli chapter}.

To begin with a simple example we consider $\cH^\circ_{2,3,5}$ again. By the property of $M_{2}$ as a coarse moduli space, there is a corresponding map
$$
\mu : \cH^\circ_{2,3,5} \rTo M_2.
$$
Sending each point to the isomorphism class of the curve it represents.
To analyze the fiber $\Sigma_C =\mu^{-1}(C)$ of the map $\mu$ over a point $C \in M_2$ we first use the map
$$
\nu : \Sigma_C \rTo \Pic_5(C),
$$
obtained by sending a point in $\Sigma_C$ to the line bundle $\cO_C(1)$. Proposition~\ref{2g+1} implies that any line bundle of degree 5 on a curve of genus 2 is very ample, so this map is surjective. Note that 
$h^0(\cL) = 4$, so the linear series  giving the embedding is complete. Thus, once we have specified the abstract curve $C$, and the line bundle $\cL \in \Pic_5(C)$ the embedding is determined by giving a basis for $H^0(\cL)$, up to scalars. In other words, each fiber of $\nu$ is isomorphic to $\PGL_4$. We can now work our way up from $M_2$:

\begin{enumerate}

\item[$\bullet$] We know that $M_2$ is irreducible of dimension 3.

\item[$\bullet$] It follows that the space of pairs $(C,\cL)$ with $C \in M_2$ a smooth curve of genus 2 and $\cL \in \Pic_5(C)$ is irreducible of dimension 3 + 2 = 5; and finally

\item[$\bullet$] It follows that $\cH^\circ$ is irreducible of dimension $5 + 15 = 20$.

\end{enumerate}

In fact, this approach applies to a much wider range of examples: 
\begin{proposition}\label{nonspecial Hilbert}
Whenever $d \geq 2g+1$, the space $\cH^\circ$ of smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curves $C \subset \PP^r$ is either empty (if $d-g < r$) or irreducible of dimension $4g-3 + (r+1)(d-g+1) - 1$; in particular, if $r=3$, the dimension of $\cH^\circ$ is $4d$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Consider the tower of spaces

\begin{diagram}
\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}  \\
\dTo \\
\cP_{d,g} = \{(C,\cL) \mid \cL \in \Pic_d(C) \} \\
\dTo \\
M_g.
\end{diagram}

The results of the proposition follow because:
\begin{enumerate}

\item[$\bullet$]  $M_g$ is irreducible of dimension $3g-3$;

\item[$\bullet$] it follows from the fact that the Picard variety is irreducible of dimension $g$ that $\cP_{d,g}$ is irreducible of dimension $3g-3+g = 4g-3$; and finally

\item[$\bullet$] since the fibers of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d} \to \cP_{d,g}$ consist of $(r+1)$-tuples of linearly independent sections of $\cL$ (mod scalars), and $h^0(\cL) = d-g+1$, it follows that $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ is irreducible of dimension $\dim(\cP_{d,g}) + (r+1)(d-g+1) = 4g-3 + (r+1)(d-g+1) - 1$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Proposition~\ref{nonspecial Hilbert} gives a simple and clean answer to our basic questions about the dimension and irreducibility of the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ$ in case $d \geq 2g-1$. But what happens outside of this range? In fact, we  can use Brill-Noether theory to modify this analysis to extend this beyond the range $d \geq 2g+1$.

The difference is that in general the map $\cH^\circ \to \cP_{d,g}$ is not dominant; rather, over a point $[C] \in M_g$, its image is open in the subvariety $W^r_d(C) \subset \Pic_d(C)$ parametrizing line bundles $\cL$ on $C$ of degree $d$ with at least $r+1$ sections. Now, as long as the Brill-Noether number $\rho(d,g,r)$ is non-negative, the Brill-Noether theorem tells us that for a general curve $C$, the variety $W^r_d(C)$ has dimension $\rho$, and (assuming $r \geq 3$) the general point of $W^r_d(C)$ corresponds to a very ample line bundle with exactly $r+1$ sections. In this situation, there is a unique component of $\cH_0 \subset \cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ dominating $M_g$, and the map $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d} \to \cP_{d,g}$ carries this component to a subvariety $\cW^r_d \subset \cP_{d,g}$ of dimension $3g-3 + \rho$. In sum:

\begin{theorem}\label{principal component}
Let $g, d$ and $r$ be any nonnegative integers, with Brill-Noether number  $\rho(g,r,d) = g - (r+1)(g-d+r) \geq 0$. There is then a unique component $\cH_0$ of the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ dominating the moduli space $M_g$; and this component has dimension
$$
\dim \cH_0 = 3g-3+\rho + (r+1)^2 - 1 = 4g-3 + (r+1)(d-g+1) - 1.
$$
\end{theorem}

(In the case $\rho=0$ this requires the transitivity of the monodromy (Theorem~\ref{Wrd omnibus}.) 


 The component $\cH_0$ identified in Theorem~\ref{principal component} is called the \emph{principal component} of the Hilbert scheme; there may be others as well, of possibly different dimension, and we do not know precisely for which $d,g$ and $r$ these occur. Finally, in case $\rho < 0$, the Brill-Noether theorem tells us only that there is no component of $\cH^\circ_{g,r,d}$ dominating $M_g$; we will discuss some of the outstanding questions in this range in Section~\ref{open problems} below. 



\section{Exercises}
\begin{exercise}\label{twisted cubic normal bundle}
Let $C \cong \PP^1 \subset \PP^3$. Show that the normal bundle $\cN_{C/\PP^3} \cong \cO_{\PP^1}(5)^{\oplus 2}$; that is, the normal bundle of a twisted cubic is the direct sum of two line bundles of degree 5. Use this to prove that the restricted Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ$ of twisted cubics is everywhere smooth. \end{exercise}

Hint: Restricting the presentation matrix of $I_C$ to $C$---that is, substituting the forms of degree 3 in 2 variables for the variables in the presentation matrix---we get a presentation

\begin{exercise}\label{6,3:2}
Now let $C$ again be a curve of degree 6 and genus 3, but now assume that $C$ \emph{does} lie on a quadric surface $Q$. Show that such a curve is a flat limit of curves of the type described in the last exercise, and conclude that $\cH^\circ_{3,3,6}$ is irreducible of dimension 24. (Hint: Let $L$, $Q$ and $F$ denote a general linear form, a general quadratic form and a general cubic form, and consider the pencil of surfaces $S_t = V(tF + LQ) \subset \PP^3$ specializing from the cubic surface $V(F)$ the to reducible cubic $V(LQ)$.)
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
By analyzing the geometry of linear series of degrees $2g-1$ and $2g$ on a curve of genus $g$, extend Proposition~\ref{nonspecial Hilbert} to the cases $d = 2g-1$ and $2g$. What goes wrong if $d \leq 2g-2$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{degree 7 analysis}
show that each component of the restricted Hilbert schemes of curves of degree 7
in $\PP^3$ has expected dimension 28:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $g\geq 6$
By Castelnuovo's Theorem, the largest possible genus of a curve of degree 7 in $\PP^3$ is 6, and 
by Theorem~\ref{Castelnuovo examples} or a comparison of the Hilbert polynomial
with the Hilbert polynomial of $\PP^3$, these lie on a quadric.
 \item $g=5$: show that their is a unique component, and it dominates the moduli space of curves of genus 5.
 Show that such a  curve is residual to a conic in the complete intersection of two cubics.
 \item $g\leq 4$: Since these curves are nonspecial, the there is a unique irreducible component.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}\label{bigger component}(Iarrobino)
Show that ideals generated by $a$ independent forms of degree $d$ together with all the forms of degree $d+1$ in 3 variables
form a family of 0-dimensional schemes of degree $d:={3+d\choose 3} -a$ which can be interpreted as a subvariety
of the Hilbert scheme $Hilb_d(\PP^3)$. Show that the dimension of this subvariety is $h := a({2+d\choose 2}-a)$. Find values of
$d$ and $a$ such that $h>3d$, and conclude that the Hilbert scheme $Hilb_d(\PP^3)$ has more than one component.
\end{exercise}

%%%%%Exercises originally in Ch 19:
 The next three exercises refer to the discussion of the two types of curves of degree 9 and genus 10 in Section~\ref{deg9 section}:
\begin{exercise}\label{degree 9 type 2 is irreducible}
In Section~\ref{deg9 section} we identified a locus $\cH^\circ_2$ of degree 9, genus 10 curves lying on a quadric.
One can show that $\cH^\circ_2$  is irreducible by a monodromy argument using Example~\ref{monodromy of rulings}, but one can also prove it via a liaison:  a curve in $\cH^\circ_2$ is residual to a union of three skew lines in the intersection of a quadric and a sextic curve. Use this to establish that $\cH^\circ_2$ is irreducible.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
 We used a dimension count to conclude that a general curve of type 1 could not be a specialization of a curve of type 2, and vice versa. Prove these assertions directly: specifically, argue that
\begin{enumerate}
\item by upper-semicontinuity of $h^0(\cI_{C/\PP^3}(2))$, argue that a curve $C$ not lying on a quadric cannot be the specialization of curves $C_t$ lying on quadrics; and
\item show that for a general curve of type $(3,6)$ on a quadric, $K_C \not\cong \cO_C(2)$, and deduce that a general curve of type 2 is not a specialization of curves of type 1.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2 \subset \cH^\circ_{10,3,9}$ be the loci of curves of types 1 and 2 respectively. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the intersection of the closures of $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ in $ \cH^\circ_{10,3,9}$?
\item What is the intersection of the closures of $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ in the whole Hilbert scheme $\cH_{9m-9}(\PP^3)$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


The next two exercises refer to the discussion following Proposition~\ref{2a,b}
\begin{exercise}\label{character of D}
(Guided exercise to prove this proposition: first, $D$ cannot have multiple components; then, must be disconnected.)
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}\label{many large components}
Let $\cH^\circ$ be a component of the Hilbert scheme parametrizing curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\PP^3$ that dominates the moduli space $M_g$. For $s, t \gg d$, let $\cK^\circ$ be the family of smooth curves residual to a curve $C \in  \cH^\circ$ in a complete intersection of surfaces of degrees $s$ and $t$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $\cK^\circ$ is open and dense in a component of the Hilbert scheme of curves of degree $st-d$ and the appropriate genus.
\item Calculate the dimension of $\cK^\circ$, and in particular show that it is strictly greater than $h(g,r,d)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{moduli of plane curves}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $C \subset \PP^2$ be a smooth plane curve of degree $d$. Show that the $g^2_d$ cut by lines on $C$ is unique; that is, $W^2_d(C)$ consists of one point.
\item Using this, find the dimension of the locus of smooth plane curves in $M_g$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{balanced CI}
Consider the locus of curves $C \subset \PP^3$ that are complete intersections of a quadric surface and a surface of degree $m$. Show that these comprise components of the restricted Hilbert scheme, and that their images in moduli have dimension asymptotically approaching $g$ as $m \to \infty$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\label{balanced CI in higher codim}
Consider the locus $\cH^\circ_{ci}$, in the Hilbert scheme $\cH^\circ$, of smooth, irreducible, nondegenerate curves $C \subset \PP^r$ that are complete intersections of $r-1$ hypersurfaces of degree $m$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $\cH^\circ_{ci}$ is open in $\cH^\circ$;
\item Calculate the dimension of $\cH^\circ_{ci}$ (and observe that it is irreducible); and
\item Show that the dimension of the image of $\cH^\circ_{ci}$ in $M_g$ is asymptotically $2g/r!$ as $m \to \infty$
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
