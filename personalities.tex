\section{pre-requisites and conventions}

Basic results used in this section: B\'ezout, Riemann-Roch, Lasker (aka AF+BG), Clifford, Adjunction.

Let's explicitly allow things like $\HH^0(D)$ where $D$ is a divisor, as well as $\HH^0(\cO(D))$, but be careful not to mix the two too much.

Would it be more confusing or less to use the same letter for a polynomial vanishing on $C$ and the surface it defines?


\section{Personalities}

The subject of algebraic curves abounds with examples amenable to explicit construction and analysis. In this chapter, we will survey the basic geometry and embeddings of the curves of genus 0 to  6. Our knowledge of the geometry of curves becomes increasingly less complete as the genus increases, and 6, as we shall see, is a natural turning point. 
%At the end of this chapter, the reader will be able to say with some confidence that he or she has seen every curve of genus $g \leq 6$, and understands its geometry.

\subsection{Curves of genus 0} 

\subsection{Curves of genus 1}

\subsection{Curves of genus 2}

\subsection{Curves of genus 3}

\subsection{Curves of genus 4}

As in the case of curves of genus 3, the study of curves of genus 4 bifurcates immediately into two cases: hyperelliptic and non-hyperelliptic; again, we will study the geometry of hyperelliptic curves in Chapter~\ref{****} and focus here on the nonhyperelliptic case.

In genus 4 we have a question that the elementary theory based on the Riemann-Roch formula cannot answer: are nonhyperelliptic curves of genus 4 expressible as three-sheeted covers of $\PP^1$? The answer will emerge from our analysis in Proposition~\ref{genus 4 trigonal} below.

Let $C$ be a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 4. We start by considering the canonical map $\phi_K : C \hookrightarrow \PP^3$, which embeds $C$ as a curve of degree 6 in $\PP^3$. We identify $C$ with its image, and investigate the homogeneous ideal $I = I_C$ of equations it satisfies. As in previous cases we may try to answer this by considering the restriction maps
\fix{replaced $K_C^m$ with $mK_C$.}
$$
r_m : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(m)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(m)) = \HH^0(mK_C).
$$

For $m=1$, this is by construction an isomorphism; that is, the image of $C$ is non-degenerate (not contained in any plane).

For $m=2$ we know that $\h^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(2)) = \binom{5}{3} = 10$, while by the Riemann-Roch
Theorem we have
$$
\h^0(\cO_C(2)) = 12 - 4 + 1 = 9.
$$
This shows that the curve $C \subset \PP^3$ must lie on at least one quadric surface $Q$. The quadric $Q$ must be irreducible, since any any reducible and/or non-reduced quadric must be a union of planes, and thus cannot contain an irreducible non-degenerate curve.
If $Q'\neq Q$ is any other quadric then, by B\'ezout's Theorem, $Q\cap Q'$ is a curve of degree 4 and thus could not contain $C$. From this we see that $Q$ is unique, and it follows that $r_2$ is surjective.

What about cubics? Again we consider the restriction map
$$
r_3 : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(3)) = \HH^0(3K_C).
$$
The space $\HH^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3))$ has dimension $\binom{6}{3} = 20$, while  the Riemann-Roch Theorem shows that
$$
\h^0(\cO_C(3)) = 18 - 4 + 1 = 15.
$$
It follows that the ideal of $C$ contains at least a 5-dimensional vector space of cubic polynomials. We can get a 4-dimensional subspace as products of the unique quadratic polynomial $F$ vanishing on $C$ with linear forms---these define the cubic surfaces containing $Q$. Since $5 > 4$ we  conclude that the curve $C$ lies on at least one cubic surface $S$  not containing $Q$. 
B\'ezout's Theorem shows that the curve $Q \cap S$ has degree 6; thus it must be equal to $C$. 

Let $G=0$ be the cubic form defining the surface $S$. By Lasker's Theorem the ideal $(F,G)$ is unmixed, and thus is equal to the homogeneous ideal of $C$. Putting this together, we have proven the first statement of the following result:

\begin{theorem}
The canonical model of any nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 is a complete intersection of a quadric $Q = V(F)$ and a cubic surface $S = V(G)$. Conversely, any smooth curve that is the intersection of a quadric and a cubic surface in $\PP^3$ is the canonical model of a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4.
\end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}
Let $C = Q\cap S$ with $Q$ a quadric and $S$ a cubic. Applying the Adjunction Formula to $Q\subset \PP^3$ we get
$$
\omega_Q = (\omega_{\PP^3} \otimes \cO_{\PP^3}(2))|_Q = \cO_Q(-4+2) = \cO_Q(-2).
$$
Applying it again to $C$ on $Q$, and noting that $\O_Q(C) = \O_Q(3)$, we get
$$
\omega_C = ((\omega_{Q} \otimes \cO_{3}(3))|_C = \cO_C(-2+3) = \cO_C(1)
$$
as required. 
\end{proof}

We can now answer the question we asked at the outset, whether a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 can be expressed as a three-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$. This amounts to asking if there are any divisors $D$ on $C$ of degree 3 with $r(D) \geq 1$; since we can take $D$ to be a general fiber of a map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$, we can for simplicity assume $D = p+q+r$ is the sum of three distinct points.

By the geometric Riemann-Roch theorem, a divisor $D = p+q+r$ on a canonical curve $C \subset \PP^{g-1}$ has $r(D) \geq 1$ if and only if the three points $p,q,r \in C$ are colinear. If three points $p,q,r \in C$ lie on a line $L \subset \PP^3$ then the quadric $Q$ would meet $L$ in at least three points, and hence would contain $L$. Conversely,  if $L$ is a line contained in $Q$, then the divisor $D = C \cap L = S \cap L$ on $C$ has degree  3. Thus we can answer our question in terms of the family of lines contained in $Q$.

Any smooth quadric is isomorphic to $\PP^1\times \PP^1$, and contains two families of lines, or \emph{rulings}. On the other hand, any singular quadric is a cone over a plane conic, and thus has just one ruling. By the argument above, the pencils of divisors on $C$ cut out by the lines of these rulings are the $g^1_3$s on $C$. This proves:

\begin{proposition}\label{genus 4 trigonal}
A nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 may be expressed as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ in either one or two ways, depending on whether the unique quadric containing the canonical model of the curve is singular or smooth.
\end{proposition}

A curve expressible as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ is called \emph{trigonal}; by the analyses of the preceding sections, we have shown that \emph{every curve of genus $g \leq 4$ is either hyperelliptic or trigonal}. 

We can also describe plane models of nonhyperelliptic curves $C$ of genus 4. By Clifford's Theorem a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 cannot have a $g^2_4$; in particular, there cannot be a plane model of degree 4. 

If now $D$ is a divisor of degree 5 with $r(D)=2$ then, by the Riemann-Roch Theorem,  $\h0(K-D) = 1$; that is, $D$ is of the form $K-p$ for some point $p \in C$.  There are thus two cases:

\fix{revised by DE to here, June 17}
\fix{This analysis either needs more explanation, or a preliminary section about singularities of plane curves. Also the geometry of projections (``same tangent line'') is usually NOT understood by beginning students, and needs explication here.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $C$ has two $g^1_3$s---that is, if the quadric $Q$ containing the canonical model of $C$ is smooth---then projection $\pi$ of the canonical curve from a point $p \in C$ will be an embedding, except at the  other points of intersection of $C$ with the two lines $L_1, L_2 \subset Q$ passing through $p$. If $L_i$ is transverse to $C$, the two other points of $L_i \cap C$ will map to a node of the image curve (the tangent spaces to $Q$ at the two other points of $L_i \cap C$ will be distinct, so the image curve $\pi(C)$ will have a node); if $L_i$ meets $C$ tangentially at one point other than $p$, the image curve will have a cusp. In sum, then, the plane quintic model of $C$ will have two singularities, each either a node or a cusp.

\item If $C$ has one $g^1_3$---that is, if the quadric $Q$ containing the canonical model of $C$ is a cone---then projection $\pi$ of the canonical curve from a point $p \in C$ will again be an embedding, except at the  other points of intersection of $C$ with the single line $L \subset Q$ passing through $p$. In this case, however, the tangent planes to $Q$ at points of $L$ will all be the same, so that if $L$ is transverse to $C$, the two other points of $L \cap C$ will map to a \emph{tacnode} of the image curve; if $L$ meets $C$ tangentially at one point other than $p$, the image curve will have a \emph{ramphoid cusp}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Curves of genus 5}

We consider now nonhyperelliptic curves of genus 5. There are now two questions that cannot be answered by simple application of the Riemann-Roch Theorem:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is $C$ expressible as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$? In other words, does $C$ have a $g^1_3$?; and
\item Is $C$ expressible as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$? In other words, does $C$ have a $g^1_4$?
\end{enumerate}

As we'll see, all other questions about the existence or nonexistence of linear series on $C$ can be answered by the Riemann-Roch Theorem.

As in the preceding case, the answers can be found through an investigation of the geometry of the canonical model $C \subset \PP^4$ of $C$. This is an octic curve in $\PP^4$, and as before the first question to ask is what sort of polynomial equations define $C$. We start with quadrics, by considering the restriction map
$$
r_2 : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^4}(2)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(2)).
$$
On the left, we have the space of homogeneous quadratic polynomials on $\PP^4$, which has dimension $\binom{6}{4} = 15$, while by the Riemann-Roch Theorem the target is a vector space of dimension
$$
2\cdot8 - 5 + 1 = 12.
$$
We deduce that \emph{$C$ lies on at least 3 independent quadrics}. (We will see in the course of the following analysis that it is exactly 3; that is, $r_2$ is surjective.)

The question now is, what is the intersection of the quadrics containing $C$? There are two possibilities:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the intersection $Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$ of three of the quadrics is 1-dimensional, then by Bezout it must equal $C$; that is, $C$ is a complete intersection of three quadrics. (In this case, Noether's AF+BG theorem tells us that there are no more quadrics containing $C$.)
\item If the intersection of the quadrics containing $C$ is 2-dimensional, some further analysis is required; we'll carry this out following a description of the first case.
\end{enumerate}

For the first case, suppose that the canonical curve $C \subset \PP^4$ is the complete intersection of three quadrics. We can answer the first of our two questions immediately: $C$ cannot contain three colinear points (or, more generally, a divisor of degree 3 contained in a line), because then the line $L$ containing them would necessarily lie on each of the quadrics, meaning that $C$ could not be their complete intersection.

What about $g^1_4$s? Again invoking the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem, a divisor of degree 4 moving in a pencil lies in a 2-plane; so the question is, does $C \subset \PP^4$ contain four coplanar points? Suppose first that it does: say $D = p_1+\dots +p_4 \subset C$ is contained in a 2-plane $\Lambda$. In that case, consider the restriction map
$$
\HH^0(\cI_{C/\PP^4}(2)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cI_{D/\Lambda}(2)).
$$
By hypothesis, the left hand space is 3-dimensional; but since $D$ is not contained in a line, it must impose independent conditions on quadrics, so that the right hand space is 2-dimensional. It follows that \emph{$\Lambda$ must be contained in one of the quadrics $Q$ containing $C$}; note in particular that such a quadric $Q$ is necessarily singular.

Conversely, suppose that $Q \subset \PP^4$ is a singular quadric containing $C$. $Q$ is a cone over a quadric $\overline Q$ in $\PP^3$, and just as $\overline Q$ has either one or two rulings by lines, $Q$ will be swept out by one or two families of 2-planes, each parametrized by $\PP^1$. Now say $\Lambda \subset Q$ is such a 2-plane. If $Q'$ and $Q''$ are ``the other two quadrics" containing $C$, we can write
$$
\Lambda \cap C = \Lambda \cap Q' \cap Q'', 
$$ 
from which we see that $D = \Lambda \cap C$ is a divisor of degree 4 on $C$, and so has $r(D) = 1$ by the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem. Thus, the rulings of  singular quadrics containing $C$ cut out on $C$ pencils of degree 4; and every pencil of degree 4 on $C$ arises in this way.

Does $C$ lie on singular quadrics? You bet: there is a $\PP^2$ of quadrics containing $C$---a 2-plane in the space $\PP^{14}$ of quadrics in $\PP^4$---and its intersection with the discriminant hypersurface in $\PP^{14}$ will be a plane quintic curve $B$. (Note that by Bertini not every quadric containing $C$ can be singular in this case.) So $C$ does indeed have a $g^1_4$, and is expressible as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$; in fact we can summarize our analysis in the

\begin{proposition}
Let $C \subset \PP^4$ be a canonical curve, and assume $C$ is the complete intersection of three quadrics in $\PP^4$. Then $C$ may be expressed as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ in a one-dimensional family of ways; indeed, there is a map from the set of $g^1_4$s on $C$ to a plane quintic curve $B$, whose fibers have cardinality 1 or 2.
\end{proposition}

Of course, we can go further and ask about the geometry of the plane curve $B$ and how it relates to the geometry of $C$; a fairly exhaustive list of possibilities is given in \cite{****} [ACGH]. But that's enough for now.

Let's turn our attention to the second possibility above: that the canonical curve $C \subset \PP^4$ is not a complete intersection; that is, the intersection of the quadrics containing $C$ is two-dimensional.
