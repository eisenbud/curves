\section{pre-requisites and conventions}

Basic results used in this section: B\'ezout, Riemann-Roch, Lasker (aka AF+BG), Clifford, Adjunction.

Let's explicitly allow things like $\HH^0(D)$ where $D$ is a divisor, as well as $\HH^0(\cO(D))$, but be careful not to mix the two too much.

Would it be more confusing or less to use the same letter for a polynomial vanishing on $C$ and the surface it defines?


\section{Personalities}

The subject of algebraic curves abounds with examples amenable to explicit construction and analysis. In this chapter, we will survey the basic geometry and embeddings of the curves of genus 0 to  6. Our knowledge of the geometry of curves becomes increasingly less complete as the genus increases, and 6, as we shall see, is a natural turning point. 
%At the end of this chapter, the reader will be able to say with some confidence that he or she has seen every curve of genus $g \leq 6$, and understands its geometry.

\subsection{Curves of genus 0} 

\subsection{Curves of genus 1}

\subsection{Curves of genus 2}

\subsection{Curves of genus 3}

\subsection{Curves of genus 4}

As in the case of curves of genus 3, the study of curves of genus 4 bifurcates immediately into two cases: hyperelliptic and non-hyperelliptic; again, we will study the geometry of hyperelliptic curves in Chapter~\ref{****} and focus here on the nonhyperelliptic case.

In genus 4 we have a question that the elementary theory based on the Riemann-Roch formula cannot answer: are nonhyperelliptic curves of genus 4 expressible as three-sheeted covers of $\PP^1$? The answer will emerge from our analysis in Proposition~\ref{genus 4 trigonal} below.

Let $C$ be a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 4. We start by considering the canonical map $\phi_K : C \hookrightarrow \PP^3$, which embeds $C$ as a curve of degree 6 in $\PP^3$. We identify $C$ with its image, and investigate the homogeneous ideal $I = I_C$ of equations it satisfies. As in previous cases we may try to answer this by considering the restriction maps
\fix{replaced $K_C^m$ with $mK_C$.}
$$
r_m : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(m)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(m)) = \HH^0(mK_C).
$$

For $m=1$, this is by construction an isomorphism; that is, the image of $C$ is non-degenerate (not contained in any plane).

For $m=2$ we know that $\h^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(2)) = \binom{5}{3} = 10$, while by the Riemann-Roch
Theorem we have
$$
\h^0(\cO_C(2)) = 12 - 4 + 1 = 9.
$$
This shows that the curve $C \subset \PP^3$ must lie on at least one quadric surface $Q$. The quadric $Q$ must be irreducible, since any any reducible and/or non-reduced quadric must be a union of planes, and thus cannot contain an irreducible non-degenerate curve.
If $Q'\neq Q$ is any other quadric then, by B\'ezout's Theorem, $Q\cap Q'$ is a curve of degree 4 and thus could not contain $C$. From this we see that $Q$ is unique, and it follows that $r_2$ is surjective.

What about cubics? Again we consider the restriction map
$$
r_3 : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(3)) = \HH^0(3K_C).
$$
The space $\HH^0(\cO_{\PP^3}(3))$ has dimension $\binom{6}{3} = 20$, while  the Riemann-Roch Theorem shows that
$$
\h^0(\cO_C(3)) = 18 - 4 + 1 = 15.
$$
It follows that the ideal of $C$ contains at least a 5-dimensional vector space of cubic polynomials. We can get a 4-dimensional subspace as products of the unique quadratic polynomial $F$ vanishing on $C$ with linear forms---these define the cubic surfaces containing $Q$. Since $5 > 4$ we  conclude that the curve $C$ lies on at least one cubic surface $S$  not containing $Q$. 
B\'ezout's Theorem shows that the curve $Q \cap S$ has degree 6; thus it must be equal to $C$. 

Let $G=0$ be the cubic form defining the surface $S$. By Lasker's Theorem the ideal $(F,G)$ is unmixed, and thus is equal to the homogeneous ideal of $C$. Putting this together, we have proven the first statement of the following result:

\begin{theorem}
The canonical model of any nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 is a complete intersection of a quadric $Q = V(F)$ and a cubic surface $S = V(G)$ meeting along nonsingular points of each. Conversely, any smooth curve that is the intersection of a quadric and a cubic surface in $\PP^3$ is the canonical model of a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4.
\end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}
Let $C = Q\cap S$ with $Q$ a quadric and $S$ a cubic. Because $C$ is nonsingular and a complete intersection, both $S$ and $Q$ must be nonsingular at every point of their intersection Applying the Adjunction Formula to $Q\subset \PP^3$ we get
$$
\omega_Q = (\omega_{\PP^3} \otimes \cO_{\PP^3}(2))|_Q = \cO_Q(-4+2) = \cO_Q(-2).
$$
Applying it again to $C$ on $Q$, and noting that $\O_Q(C) = \O_Q(3)$, we get
$$
\omega_C = ((\omega_{Q} \otimes \cO_{3}(3))|_C = \cO_C(-2+3) = \cO_C(1)
$$
as required. 
\end{proof}

We can now answer the question we asked at the outset, whether a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 can be expressed as a three-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$. This amounts to asking if there are any divisors $D$ on $C$ of degree 3 with $r(D) \geq 1$; since we can take $D$ to be a general fiber of a map $\pi : C \to \PP^1$, we can for simplicity assume $D = p+q+r$ is the sum of three distinct points.

By the geometric Riemann-Roch theorem, a divisor $D = p+q+r$ on a canonical curve $C \subset \PP^{g-1}$ has $r(D) \geq 1$ if and only if the three points $p,q,r \in C$ are colinear. If three points $p,q,r \in C$ lie on a line $L \subset \PP^3$ then the quadric $Q$ would meet $L$ in at least three points, and hence would contain $L$. Conversely,  if $L$ is a line contained in $Q$, then the divisor $D = C \cap L = S \cap L$ on $C$ has degree  3. Thus we can answer our question in terms of the family of lines contained in $Q$.

Any smooth quadric is isomorphic to $\PP^1\times \PP^1$, and contains two families of lines, or \emph{rulings}. On the other hand, any singular quadric is a cone over a plane conic, and thus has just one ruling. By the argument above, the pencils of divisors on $C$ cut out by the lines of these rulings are the $g^1_3$s on $C$. This proves:

\begin{proposition}\label{genus 4 trigonal}
A nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 may be expressed as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ in either one or two ways, depending on whether the unique quadric containing the canonical model of the curve is singular or smooth.
\end{proposition}

\fix{include this?} (One might ask why the non-singularity of the cubic surface $S$ plays no role. However, $G$ is determined only up to a multiple of $F$, and it follows that the linear series of cubics in the ideal
$I_C$ has only base points along $C$. Bertini's Theorem says that a general element of this series will be nonsingular away from $C$; and since any every irreducible cubic in the family must be nonsingular along $C$, it follows that the general such cubic is nonsingular.)

A curve expressible as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ is called \emph{trigonal}; by the analyses of the preceding sections, we have shown that \emph{every curve of genus $g \leq 4$ is either hyperelliptic or trigonal}. 

We can also describe the lowest degree plane models of nonhyperelliptic curves $C$ of genus 4. 
We can always get a plane model of degree 5 by projecting $C$ from a point $p$ of the canonical model of $C$. Moreover, the Riemann-Roch Theorem shows that if $D$ is a divisor of degree 5 with $r(D)=2$ then,  $\h^0(K-D) = 1$. Thus $D$ is of the form $K-p$ for some point $p \in C$, and the map to $\PP^2$ corresponding to $D$ is $\pi_p$. These  maps $\pi_p: C\to \PP^2$ have the lowest possible degree (except for those whose image is  contained in a line) because, by Clifford's Theorem a nonhyperelliptic curve of genus 4 cannot have a $g^2_4$.

We now consider the singularities of the plane quintic $\pi_p(C)$. Suppose as above that $C = Q\cap S$, with $Q$ a quadric. If a line $L$ through $p$ meets $C$ in $p$ plus a divisor of degree $\geq 2$ then, as we have seen, $L$ must lie in $Q$.  All other lines through $p$ meet $C$ in at most a single points, so $\pi_p$ whose images are thus nonsingular points of $\pi(C)$, and $\pi_C$ is one-to-one there. Moreover, a line that met $C$ in $>3$ points would have to lie in both the quadric and the cubic containing $C$, and therefore would be contained in $C$. Since $C$ is irreducible there can be no such line.

We distinguish two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $Q$ is nonsingular:
In this case there are two lines $L_1, L_2$ on $Q$ that pass through $p$; they meet $C$ in $p$ plus divisors $E_1$ and $E_2$ of degree 2. If $E_i$ consists of distinct points, then, since the tangent planes to the quadric along $L_i$ are all distinct $\pi(C)$ will have a node at their common image. 

\fix{do we expect the reader to know this about quadrics, or should we prove it? or should we argue that since there are two distinct branches and a plane quintic of genus 2 can have only the equivalent of two double points, these must be simple?? The first option is probably better.}

On the other hand, if $E_i$ consists of a double point $2q$ (that is, $L_i$ is tangent to $C$ at $q\neq p$, or meets $C$ 3 times at $q = p$), then $\pi(C)$ will have a cusp at the corresponding image point. 
In either case, $\pi(C)$ has two distinct singular points, each either a node or a cusp. The two $g^1_3$s on $C$ correspond to the projections from these singular points.

\item $Q$ is a cone:
In this case, since the curve cannot pass through the singular point of $Q$ there is a unique line $L\subset Q$ that passes through $p$. Let $p+E$ be the divisor on $C$ in which this line meets $C$. The tangent planes to $Q$ along $L$ are all the same. Thus if $E = q_1+q_2$ consists of two distinct points, the image $\pi_p(C)$ will have two smooth branches sharing a common tangent line at
$\pi_p(q_1) = \pi_p(q_2)$. Such a point is called a \emph{tacnode} of $\pi_p(C)$. On the other hand, if $E= 2q$, that is, if $L$ meets $C$ tangentially at one point $q\neq p$ (or meets $C$ 3 times at $p$) then the image curve will have a higher order cusp, called a \emph{ramphoid cusp}. In either case, the one $g^1_3$ on $C$ is the projection from the unique singular point of $\pi(C)$.
\end{enumerate}

\fix{add pictures illustrating some of the possibilities above.}


\subsection{Curves of genus 5}

We consider now nonhyperelliptic curves of genus 5. There are now two questions that cannot be answered by simple application of the Riemann-Roch Theorem:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is $C$ expressible as a 3-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$? In other words, does $C$ have a $g^1_3$?
\item Is $C$ expressible as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$? In other words, does $C$ have a $g^1_4$?
\end{enumerate}

As we'll see, all other questions about the existence or nonexistence of linear series on $C$ can be answered by the Riemann-Roch Theorem.

As in the preceding case, the answers can be found through an investigation of the geometry of the canonical model $C \subset \PP^4$ of $C$. This is an octic curve in $\PP^4$, and as before the first question to ask is what sort of polynomial equations define $C$. We start with quadrics, by considering the restriction map
$$
r_2 : \HH^0(\cO_{\PP^4}(2)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cO_{C}(2)).
$$
On the left, we have the space of homogeneous quadratic polynomials on $\PP^4$, which has dimension $\binom{6}{4} = 15$, while by the Riemann-Roch Theorem the target is a vector space of dimension
$$
2\cdot8 - 5 + 1 = 12.
$$
We deduce that $C$ lies on at least 3 independent quadrics. We will see in the course of the following analysis that it is exactly 3; that is, $r_2$ is surjective.) Since $C$ is irreducible and, by construction, does not lie on a hyperplane, each of the quadrics containing $C$ is irreducible, and thus the intersection of any two is a surface of degree 4. There are now two possibilities:  The intersection of (some) three quadrics $Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$ containing the curve is 1-dimensional; or every such intersection is two dimensional. 

We first consider the case where $Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$ is 1-dimensional. By the principal ideal theorem the intersection has no 0-dimensional components. By B\'ezout's Theorem the intersection is a curve of degree 8, and since $C$ also has degree 8 we must have $C=Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$. Lasker's Theorem then shows that the three quadrics $Q_i$ generate the whole homogeneous ideal of $C$.

We can now answer the first of our two questions for curves of this type. As in the genus 4 case the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem implies that $C$ has a $g^1_3$ if and only if the canonical model of $C$ contains 3 colinear points or, more generally, meets a line $L$ in a divisor of 3 points. When $C$ is the intersection of quadrics, this cannot happen, since the line $L$ would have to be contained in all the quadrics that contain $C$ and $L\subset C$, which is absurd. Thus, in this case, 
$C$ has no $g^1_3$.

What about $g^1_4$s? Again invoking the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem, a divisor of degree 4 moving in a pencil lies in a 2-plane; so the question is, does $C \subset \PP^4$ contain a divisor of degree 4, say $D = p_1+\dots +p_4 \subset C$, that lies in a plane $\Lambda$? Supposing this is so, we consider the restriction map
$$
\HH^0(\cI_{C/\PP^4}(2)) \; \to \; \HH^0(\cI_{D/\Lambda}(2)).
$$
By hypothesis, the left hand space is 3-dimensional; but any four noncolinear points in the plane  impose independent conditions on quadrics, \fix{this is a scheme of length 4; how is the reader supposed to cope with this if we don't assume the notion of a scheme, at least a finite one? And does the reader really know this fact about schemes of length 4 in the plane?} so that the right hand space is 2-dimensional. It follows that \emph{$\Lambda$ must be contained in one of the quadrics $Q$ containing $C$}. 

The quadrics in $\P^4$ that contain 2-planes are exactly the singular quadrics: such a quadric is a cone over a quadric in $\P^3$, and it is ruled by the (one or two) families of 2-planes it contains, which are the cones over the (one or two) rulings of the quadric in $\P^3$. The argument above shows that the existence of a $g_4^1$s on $C$ in this case implies the existence of a singular quadric containing $C$.

Conversely, suppose that $Q \subset \PP^4$ is a singular quadric containing $C = Q_1 \cap Q_2 \cap Q_3$. Now say $\Lambda \subset Q$ is  a 2-plane. If $Q'$ and $Q''$ are ``the other two quadrics" containing $C$, we can write
$$
\Lambda \cap C = \Lambda \cap Q' \cap Q'', 
$$ 
from which we see that $D = \Lambda \cap C$ is a divisor of degree 4 on $C$, and so has $r(D) = 1$ by the geometric Riemann-Roch Theorem. Thus, the rulings of  singular quadrics containing $C$ cut out on $C$ pencils of degree 4; and every pencil of degree 4 on $C$ arises in this way.

Does $C$ lie on singular quadrics? There is a $\PP^2$ of quadrics containing $C$---a 2-plane in the space $\PP^{14}$ of quadrics in $\PP^4$---and the family of singular quadrics  consists of a  hypersurface of degree 5 in $\PP^{14}$--called the \emph{discriminant} hypersurface. By Bertini's Theorem, not every quadric containing $C$ is singular. Thus the set of singular quadrics containing $C$ is a plane curve $B$ cut out by a quintic equation. So $C$ does indeed have a $g^1_4$, and is expressible as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$. In sum, we have proven:

\begin{proposition}
Let $C \subset \PP^4$ be a canonical curve, and assume $C$ is the complete intersection of three quadrics in $\PP^4$. Then $C$ may be expressed as a 4-sheeted cover of $\PP^1$ in a one-dimensional family of ways, and there is a map from the set of $g^1_4$s on $C$ to a plane quintic curve $B$, whose fibers have cardinality 1 or 2.
\end{proposition}

\fix{could the "quintic curve" be reducible/multiple? Just a line?}
Of course, we can go further and ask about the geometry of the plane curve $B$ and how it relates to the geometry of $C$; a fairly exhaustive list of possibilities is given in \cite{****} [ACGH]. But that's enough for now.

Let's turn our attention to the second possibility above: that the canonical curve $C \subset \PP^4$ is not a complete intersection; that is, the intersection of the quadrics containing $C$ is two-dimensional.
\fix{need to complete this; also to either follow through on the promise at the beginning of the subsection that ``all other questions'' are answered by RR, which is presumably more elementary. Are we really going to assume a whole knowledge of scrolls??}
